what a terrific crowd !
welcome to my inauguration !
i &apos;m lucy . lucy mirando , of the mirando corporation .
welcome to my grandfather &apos;s old factory .
now , i know , we all know , that grandpa mirando was a terrible man .
we know of the atrocities he committed in this space .
we know these walls are stained with the blood of fine working men .
but today , i reclaim this space ... to tell you a beautiful story .
now the rotten ceos are gone .
it &apos;s mirando &apos;s new era with me , and with new core values , environment and life .
awesome .
you &apos;re much more fun than the last chief executive .
well , former ceo nancy &apos;s my sister , but ...
we &apos;re very different people .
we have very different ways of being . we have very different business ethics .
but she &apos;s totally ignorant about humanity .
she lacks vision beyond her next round of golf .
the world &apos;s population is at seven billion .
805 million human beings struggle with hunger every day , including 30 million right here in the united states .
the world is running out of food , and we &apos;re not talking about it .
we needed a miracle .
and then we got one .
say hello to a super piglet .
this beautiful and special little creature was miraculously discovered on one chilean farm .
we brought this precious girl to the mirando ranch in arizona .
our scientists have been raising her with love and care ever since , observing and performing various studies .
and we &apos;ve successfully reproduced 26 miracle piglets by nonforced , natural mating .
they are like nothing on earth .
last week , we sent the 26 super piglets to the 26 countries where the mirando offices are located .
each one was given to an esteemed local farmer .
i have asked each farmer to raise their special guest , honoring traditional techniques unique to their respective cultures .
my top scientists in the mirando branch offices will be on hand to offer whatever support is required .
these little piggies will be the ancestors of a whole new species .
mama nature &apos;s gift .
a revolution in the livestock industry .
and now we have a competition !
one local farmer will raise the biggest , most beautiful and special one .
the ultimate super pig !
but who will it be ?
i &apos;m not an expert , but i know someone who is .
tv &apos;s most beloved zoologist and veterinarian , and the new face of the mirando corporation ,
dr. johnny wilcox !
who said a brilliant scientist can &apos;t be fun ?
see , everybody wants to eat him up .
when the competition reaches its climax ,
dr. johnny will crown the winner at a magical animals live telecast right here in new york city .
and that is when we will unveil our super pigs to the world !
how long will the wait be ?
when do we get to see the big pig with our own eyes ?
ten years .
ten years ?
jesus christ , i &apos;ll be dead by then .
our super pigs will not only be big and beautiful , they will also leave a minimal footprint on the environment , consume less feed and produce less excretions .
and most importantly ... they need to taste fucking good .
it won &apos;t hurt . don &apos;t move .
it &apos;s okay .
not too hard !
they &apos;re not even ripe yet .
you had some already !
okja !
okja , what are you doing ?
look at all the fish here !
i want fish stew today !
what ?
now ?
again ?
mija !
is she not here yet ?
mija !
where has she gone off to ?
mija joo of 37-1 , sanyang town !
promptly return home for dinner . mija !
come home quick . grandpa is starving !
don &apos;t be scared . it &apos;s a shortcut .
no !
go back up !
where are you ?
mundo from the office is coming to visit .
mundo ?
to collect the money for okja ?
i &apos;ve already sent them the money .
so okja is ours now , right ?
of course .
so why is he coming ?
paperwork ?
they said soccer would be on .
son of a ...
great .
now we can buy a new tv .
this one &apos;s still fine .
such a tightwad ...
welcome . hard climb ?
good afternoon .
here , have some water .
i thought a bunch of you were coming .
they &apos;re behind me .
always on top of her dental hygiene !
wait , wait . let me out , okja .
mundo ?
hello , mundo .
- did you brush your own teeth ?
- yeah .
retina display !
bring me the black box .
does okja eat and poop well ?
yes , and she has a super-high metabolism .
right . that &apos;s what the readings say .
fuck me !
i &apos;m here !
all right !
i &apos;m fucking here , god damn it !
he ... he &apos;s that guy !
from tv , right ?
he is .
what was it ?
animal magic !
he &apos;s the &quot; very healthy &quot; guy !
all the other super pigs were on flat land , accessible by car .
japan &apos;s one was five minutes from the airport .
and you ...
i notice that you had to leave the fucking mountaintop super pig till the end , because you knew that the climb would rile me .
well , guess what ?
i &apos;m riled .
he looks exactly like he does on tv .
oh , that &apos;s great .
can somebody ...
can somebody at least bring me some water ?
seeing as i &apos;m about to be filmed for fucking television !
and not sparkling water . i don &apos;t want to belch my way through the broadcast .
get him some water .
i don &apos;t think they have sparkling water here .
excuse me , sir .
if you don &apos;t mind , dr. johnny &apos;s a bit thirsty .
thank you .
here &apos;s your water .
wait . that &apos;s soju ...
hey , that &apos;s mine ...
hey , okja .
it &apos;s okay . come on out .
that &apos;s it ...
very good .
well , fucking film me , jennifer !
you can &apos;t fake these emotions .
film him .
get him his uniform . quick .
they &apos;re filming !
pick up his bag . come on .
that &apos;s it . is your ...
mundo ?
mundo , get out of the shot , please . thank you very much . that &apos;s it .
and his hat . get his hat . looking good , dr. johnny .
that &apos;s it . everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
mundo , get out of the shot . thank you very much .
and ... roll .
ten years ago , 26 local farmers from 26 far-flung countries were each given a super piglet .
- what &apos;s he saying ?
- dunno .
one of those 26 farms to decide who will be invited to the best super pig fest in new york city , where it will be unveiled to the world .
you &apos;ve done an incredible job .
thank you .
pan to the old man !
- pan to johnny .
- johnny , johnny !
ever since she was little , i &apos;ve always been fascinated with okja and her monthly health reports and data .
i &apos;ve only known her through numbers and graphs and pictures , but seeing her here today , and studying her with my own eyes and hands , she amazes me even more .
this is it .
the moment of mutual trust between mirando &apos;s very own dr. johnny and the esteemed local farmer .
she &apos;s truly exceptional .
how did you do it ?
what were your methods ?
he just let her run around .
&quot; he just let her run around . &quot; how beguiling !
show the sash to the camera , jennifer , and go ...
- ready for the festival in new york city ?
- new york ?
very healthy .
one more sash , please .
a special sash for a special little lady , who i &apos;m sure helped raise this super pig in her own special little way .
and cut . get some cutaways of the pig !
here . autograph , please .
i guess i &apos;m still hip in korea .
the kids at home don &apos;t really appreciate me anymore .
but here ...
i &apos;m sorry if i was a little grumpy when i first came to the farm .
but , you know , being a television presenter can be stressful .
i always have to be &quot; on , &quot;
now that i &apos;m the face of the mirando corporation .
who ever thought that would happen ?
mija . let &apos;s go visit your mom and dad .
now ?
i want to watch this .
they &apos;ll be doing this all day .
your mom and dad appeared in my dream last night and said they missed you .
come on .
thank you .
come quick .
it won &apos;t take long .
who do you miss more ?
mom or dad ?
i can &apos;t remember ... their faces .
it &apos;s been so many years .
just the two of us in the mountains .
not two . three .
oh , sure . three .
the three of us .
okja , too .
our little fatty !
what &apos;s that ?
this is ... a gold pig .
100 % real gold .
in the old days , the elders would give a gold pig to their daughters as a wedding gift .
mija , it &apos;s yours now .
take it .
why all of a sudden ?
well , you &apos;re not getting married now ... but ...
okja is going far away ... so you can keep this gold pig instead .
what ?
the pig competition &apos;s nearly over .
so they &apos;re taking all the pigs back to the company .
but okja &apos;s ours .
we bought her from them .
you sent them the money !
actually ... they wouldn &apos;t let me buy okja .
so i bought you this gold pig instead .
what are you talking about ?
hey , did you hear that ?
your daughter raises her voice at me now .
mija .
they say okja was selected as the best pig .
they have plans for her in america .
america ?
she &apos;ll spend the night at the mirando building in seoul .
and tomorrow , she &apos;ll be on a plane to america .
she &apos;s a celebrity now !
mija .
to be honest ... you &apos;re nearly a grown woman now .
i don &apos;t like you playing with that pig all day .
you should go to town , meet a boy and ...
you must be hungry .
i made your favorite , chicken stew .
go wash up so we can eat .
i put in this and that .
everything that &apos;s good for you .
where are you going ?
seoul .
what ?
i &apos;m going to bring okja home .
are you crazy ?
seoul ?
in the middle of the night ?
you have no money to go to seoul .
stop !
it &apos;s dangerous . don &apos;t move !
oh , my god ...
oh , god ...

where do you think you &apos;re going ?
you &apos;re not going anywhere !

he &apos;s having a shitty day .
it &apos;s beautiful .
and eco-friendly , you know ?
hey , baby , it &apos;s me .
what kind of body wash do we have ?
fruity lucy lemon ?
because the girl showed up , so i &apos;m providing the team with unfolding intel .
- i don &apos;t care . it still sounds creepy .
- i &apos;m not creepy .
that &apos;s not ...
that &apos;s my voice . that &apos;s my actual voice .
my name is jay .
he &apos;s jay .
my name is k .
i &apos;m red .
- silver .
- i &apos;m blond .
i &apos;m mija . this is okja .
we are animal lovers .
we rescue animals from slaughterhouses , zoos , labs .
we tear down cages and set them free .
this is why we rescued okja .
thank you very much .
for 40 years , our group has liberated animals from places of abuse .
- is that it ?
- yeah .
go on .
- it &apos;s very important she gets every word . - it &apos;s all right .
that &apos;s it .
we inflict economic damage on those who profit from their misery .
we reveal their atrocities to the public .
and we never harm anyone , human or nonhuman .
that is our 40-year credo .
we ... fight people who harm animals ...
- what was the second thing you said ?
- we reveal their atrocities ...
- are you okay , silver ?
- i &apos;m fine .
- you okay ? - i &apos;m good .
i &apos;m good .
he still hasn &apos;t eaten anything ?
no , he &apos;s ... still trying to leave the smallest footprint on the planet that he can .
all food production is exploitative .
try this .
come on . it &apos;s just a tomato .
ripened in ethylene gas . transported in trucks .
i admire your conviction , silver , but your pallid complexion concerns me .
how long have you and okja lived together ?
since she was four .
do you know where she was being taken ?
to america . to the best super pig competition .
yes . but she was being taken somewhere else first .
this is where they &apos;re really taking okja .
this underground laboratory in paramus , new jersey .
this is the building where okja was created .
she thinks she was born in arizona and her mom in chile .
mija . everything you believe you know about okja is a lie .
okja was created in this lab . so was her so-called mother .
this is the building where mirando experiments on their genetically mutated animals .
because genetic mutation is too dangerous ,
mirando &apos;s been disguising it as natural , safe and non-gmo .
but that &apos;s a complete scam .
millions of gm pigs are already lining up in front of slaughterhouses .
you and the other local farmers are just promotional devices for them .
just a picturesque backdrop .
promotion .
mirando know their consumers would be disgusted by the idea of eating mutant , gm foods .
so ten years ago , their boss , lucy mirando , went inside the lab and dug around amongst all the disfigured creatures to find the 26 prettiest ones , like your okja .
and then , big fanfare , she sent them around the world .
they &apos;ve been frantically breeding their super pigs , and soon the supermarkets will be filled with their flesh and organs .
dog food , hot dogs , bacon and jerky ...
our plan is to put a stop to their project .
but to do so , we need video from inside the lab , footage of the horrible atrocities being committed against the animals .
and there &apos;s a problem . the security is impenetrable .
but there is a way .
although we will only go ahead with it if you give us your consent .
jay . if this kid doesn &apos;t give her consent , what , we just abandon the mission ?
is that what you &apos;re saying ?
&apos;cause , brother , we &apos;ve come halfway around the world for this .
- we should get this done now .
- don &apos;t be so selfish .
this isn &apos;t about you or us , and she is okja &apos;s family .
so of course we need her consent .
i will not harm her by forcing a mission upon her that she does not consent to .
as members of the a.l.f. , we are obliged to honor its credo .
we are going to abort because some guy from the 1970s wrote a fucking credo ?
is that what you &apos;re saying ?
tradition does not make a movement strong .
we make a movement strong .
if that &apos;s how you feel , call yourself something else and not the a.l.f. , and get out of this truck .
in order to expose mirando , we need video from inside the lab .
and this is where okja comes in .
the mirando scientists are dying to run tests on her in their underground lab .
their star super pig . which is why we &apos;ve made this .
it looks exactly like the black box on her ear , right ?
only this one can wirelessly send a video feed to us from inside the lab .
okja will become a hidden camera .
hey , buddy .
hi .
okay .
i &apos;m sorry , but this was our plan .
rescue okja , replace the black box and let mirando retake okja .
you want to send okja to america ?
to this laboratory ?
yes . but don &apos;t worry .
they wouldn &apos;t dare hurt her .
she needs to be perfect for their beauty pageant .
whatever tests they do on her in there will need to be harmless .
we have a detailed plan on how to rescue her from the event in new york city .
we promise to bring her back to you .
if our mission succeeds , we &apos;ll be able to shut down mirando &apos;s super pig project completely .
and we &apos;ll be saving millions of super pigs like okja from death .
but we won &apos;t do it without your approval .
if you don &apos;t approve , we won &apos;t do the mission .
what is your decision ?
take okja back to the mountains .
she agrees to the mission .
thank you .
- thank you so much .
- this is a giant leap for animal kind .
thank you .
it &apos;s ziploc .
- water won &apos;t be so bad .
- it &apos;ll be great !
move ! move !
i &apos;m gonna do it ! holy shit , i &apos;m gonna do it !
go , go , go , go , go , go .
hey !
okja , i &apos;ll see you in new york .
till we meet again .
mija !
try learning english . it opens new doors !
hey , wait !
mister !
hey , you !
grab him !
he jumped !
how did he do that ?
hey , kid . it &apos;s dangerous .
get out of there .
hey , kid . hey , come out !
- are you kidding me ?
- it &apos;s supposed to hold .
you &apos;re a fucking joke-show , mate .
- fucking awesome , epic plan , man .
- it &apos;s a ziploc .
- fucking ziploc , my ass .
- it was supposed to hold .
seriously ?
- you okay ?
- yeah .
last night in south korea ,
mirando employees were securing their super pig when a young girl suddenly stepped in and tried to stop them .
these extraordinary events began earlier in the day with a highly-organized pignapping attempt made by the animal liberation front .
i wouldn &apos;t worry too much , luce . the a.l.f. technically failed .
they weren &apos;t even able to take the product .
yeah , it &apos;s a kerfuffle over nothing . we shouldn &apos;t make a big deal out of it .
it actually means our security here in the us is so airtight , they wouldn &apos;t even think about breaking in .
which is why they went all the way to korea .
the a.l.f. hasn &apos;t been in the headlines for a number of years , but they &apos;re back in the spotlight after today &apos;s chaotic events .
well , the good news is that the pig is on its way to new york now .
right . and the best super pig fest will continue as planned .
significant damage to mirando &apos;s stock price seems inevitable .
yeah . mirando is completely fucked .
mirando . that &apos;s your current employer , correct ?
yup . but i don &apos;t care .
they fucked , not me .
they fucked up .
i know what they &apos;re calling me , those a.l.f. fuckers .
they &apos;re calling me a psychopath .
you &apos;re not a psychopath .
they &apos;re the psychopaths . right , ms. mirando ?
they &apos;re narcissists .
do narcissists wear balaclavas ?
crazy radicals have been calling us psychopaths since the &apos; 60s .
&quot; you &apos;re a psychopath .
your sister was a psychopath . your father was a psychopath . &quot;
well , daddy was a psychopath , frank . i mean , that &apos;s hardly an unfair slur .
&quot; what did you do in the war , daddy ? &quot;
&quot; i manufactured the napalm that made everybody &apos;s skin fall off . &quot;
and this is a man who called his child an idiot loser .
well , in fairness to your father , when he called you an idiot loser , you had just signed up for a two-year course in california called &quot; unleash your calling . &quot;
at a highly-respected institute for the advancement of human potential where many a forward-looking ceo go .
and you know what i was doing while i was at the institute ?
i was visualizing new and better ways of doing business .
while my sister was ceo ...
what was the name of that lake ?
moose lake .
moose lake .
while my sister was ceo , dumping so much toxic waste into moose lake that it exploded ...
the only lake ever to explode . well done , nancy .
i was visualizing ways of turning the most hated agrochemical company in the world into the most likeable miracle pig-rearing company .
and it &apos;s working ! it &apos;s working !
it was working until last night .
until six hours ago .
the synthesis of old mirando and new mirando was impeccable .
i took nature and science , and i synthesized .
and everyone loved it .
you remember what the new york times said about our super pigs ?
&quot; intriguing , &quot; right ?
slate ! &quot; lucy mirando is pulling off the impossible .
she is making us fall in love with a creature that we are already looking forward to eating . &quot;
i mean , these are journalists who never write about pigs .
they never write about pigs !
they wrote about our pigs .
ten years in planning !
on the cusp of a product launch that will feed millions !
and what happens ?
we get tangled up in this terrorism thing , and somehow we end up being the ones who look bad .
we don &apos;t look too bad .
- we don &apos;t ?
open that thing !
- yup .
no , rewind . rewind .
rewind !
okay , play .
the girl was later revealed to be the granddaughter of a local farmer selected by mirando ceo ...
pause , there .
that &apos;s it .
that is the image that is gonna destroy us .
who are those morons ?
find out and fire them .
sure .
abusing that adorable girl .
and in the uniforms that i personally designed myself .
and shoving her best friend onto a truck .
that &apos;s gonna kill us .
right there . that &apos;s it .
that image . we &apos;re dead .
lucy , may i ask you a question ?
the girl . you &apos;re thinking of bringing her to new york , aren &apos;t you ?
i was about to say that !
yes , of course .
you &apos;ll invite her to the best super pig festival and ...
a moving reunion !
the best super pig and the adorable farmer girl forced apart and somehow brought together on our stage .
brilliant , lucy .
an emotional reunion , and then they leave the stage together .
hand in hand . hand in trotter .
she can be the new face of the mirando corporation .
she can be the embodiment of the mirando ideal .
she &apos;s young , she &apos;s pretty , she &apos;s female .
she &apos;s eco-friendly and she &apos;s global ! she &apos;s a godsend !
are you writing this down ?
she &apos;s not the face of the mirando corporation . i am .
you don &apos;t even know if she can do anything but cry .
whereas i am loved ... all over the world .
could you sit down and shut the fucking squeaking and whining ?
you know ...
you are forcing me ...
i &apos;m forcing you to do what ?
to examine my options .
oh , really ?
okay .
go ahead . examine them .
are you examining them now ?
have you finished examining them ?
sit . you &apos;re a deadbeat .
your ratings are shit . epic fail .
jennifer , get her a first class ticket .
get her a passport . she probably hasn &apos;t got a passport . get her a visa .
we &apos;ll pay for all the damage the super pig did in korea .
get an attorney on that .
don &apos;t force an image on her , like benetton did with those asian models .
no . i have a much better idea .
okay , we got it all figured out . we got a strategy . we got a plan .
we &apos;re gonna think of it like a love story .
yeah , that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do . hand those bits of paper quickly , come on .
we got a little girl running around the city all alone .
we &apos;ve got a big , big giant pig .
we gotta bring them back together because they miss each other .
tell &apos; em to go to new york city .
look at her , so sweet .
cute . totally gorgeous .
totally sexy . hot , tiny , perfect .
at this rate , she &apos;ll be doing mirando commercials .
- it &apos;s very likely !
- thank you !
- mija !
- mija .
everything is worked out !
don &apos;t worry about a thing .
let &apos;s take a photo for our company twitter .
hold this .
get okja on the phone now !
i want to know how she &apos;s doing .
on the phone ?
with a pig ?
and we gotta tell this to everybody in new york city !
on instagram , on youtube , on tumblr , on facebook , on twitter .
okja . okja , the giant pig . she &apos;s , like , this big .
she &apos;s , like , oh , my god . she &apos;s bigger .
yeah , she &apos;s got one big , giant nipple .

we &apos;re seeing what okja &apos;s seeing .
enjoy this moment .
because soon the whole world will know what we know .
oh , my god , jay . we &apos;re about to change everything .
with my shiny antennae .
i &apos;ll put some distance between us and them .
we have to test how far the signal reaches .
oh , man . we &apos;re really cooking now .
there she goes .
- okja gets to see everything .
- quiet .
this is historical . it &apos;s historical . this is history .
okja !
hi !
we &apos;re reunited .
in this wretched laboratory , no less .
someone you &apos;re going to find very special .
here is alfonso !
where is he ?
i got a special treat for lucy &apos;s star super pig .
chop , chop !
let me introduce you to someone .
alfonso , okja !
okja , alfonso !
your boyfriend .

- come .
- are we recording ?
yeah .
oh , my god .
we should never have sent her there .
can you turn it off , please ?
no .
no , we need to record this . we need to show this .
at least turn the volume down .
- we knowingly sent her to that hellhole .
- no , we didn &apos;t .
we didn &apos;t know they were gonna do this to her .
we didn &apos;t know they were gonna put her through this mating .
we suspected !
come on , we all suspected .
turn it off !
i know it &apos;s painful .
but we can &apos;t be weak .
that &apos;s right .
this is why we need to stay focused .
this is why we need to stick to the mission .
the little girl trusted us with okja . we have to respect her bravery .
she never agreed to send okja .
what &apos;d you just say ?
she was in our truck .
she said ...
i wanna take okja back to the mountains .
i lied .
- god .
- why did you lie ?
i don &apos;t know . in that moment , it &apos;s just ... i couldn &apos;t ...
i couldn &apos;t stop the mission .
you know , this is ...
this is the coolest mission ever .
- i have all this stuff and ...
- hey , k ... k .
it &apos;s okay .
i hold you dear to my heart , but you have dishonored the 40-year history and meaningful legacy of the animal liberation front .
you have betrayed the great minds and brave fighters that have preceded you .
never mistranslate .
translation is sacred .
from this moment on , you are no longer a member of the a.l.f. you are permanently banned .
get out .
however ... since it is vital that we continue with our mission , we will return your equipment to you after its completion .
consider this your final contribution to the a.l.f .
shit .
oh , my god .
you want some ?
it &apos;ll make you feel better .
this is an unspeakable place .
i know . i know .
there are worse rooms out there .
lucy mirando says i &apos;m not supposed to harm you in here .
well , at least not visibly .
she wants you perfect for her big telecast !
but ... when a woman humiliates a man in front of his own colleagues , a man is inclined to make his own decisions .
this is nothing , really .
it &apos;s used on beef . i mean , live cows .
to check their marbling .
hi , dr. johnny . is okja with you ?
yes !
our precious farmer princess insists that she speaks to her on the phone .
what ?
whatever . she says you should lift her ear and put the receiver underneath .
- you &apos;re on speakerphone !
- okja !
okja !
okja !
are you okay ?
okja ! okja !
what did you say ?
i can &apos;t hear you !
okja !
are you okay ?
bang !
sirloin .
the shank .
don &apos;t worry . you won &apos;t die .
we &apos;re just gonna take some of your meat .
and of course , i &apos;m not gonna eat any .
we have tasters for that .
they &apos;re a bunch of half-wit , degenerate fucktards !
i &apos;m gonna ... i &apos;m gonna poke you in five places .
and i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s gonna hurt .
i shouldn &apos;t be here .
i &apos;m an animal lover .
everybody knows that about me !
tasty .
fuck , yeah .
that was the best i &apos;ve ever had . the best of the best .
today mirando presents to you our super gourmet sausage .
juicy like you &apos;ve never tasted before .
an exquisite taste with a very affordable price !
made fresh from our naturally-grown , grade a super pigs .
very healthy !
come and try !
pink streamers , pink fireworks .
lucy &apos;s gonna be so happy . i &apos;m gonna get my bonus ...
what the hell is this ?
that &apos;s lucy &apos;s autograph . &quot; designed by lucy mirando . &quot;
she can &apos;t get enough of herself , can she ?
hey !
how &apos;s everyone doing ?
still with this thing . it looks super tacky .
don &apos;t touch it !
don &apos;t touch it .
okay , okay . the fanny pack is fine .
i think she understands some english . so we should be careful what we say .
yes , yes , everything is fine .
but you have to wear this .
it &apos;s a special edition , custom-made , just for you .
look . the ceo even autographed it .
totally rad , right ?
now , let &apos;s put it on .
not until i see okja .
mija ...
think about how dramatic it will be .
okja ... okja doesn &apos;t even know you &apos;re here .
if you show up on stage without telling her , it &apos;ll be such a great surprise .
you know ?
surprise ?
i don &apos;t care about that . i want to see okja first . or i won &apos;t cooperate .
- mija ...
- she said no .
mija . mija , i don &apos;t think you understand this situation .
no , no , no . we are the ones who have okja . okay ?
we are doing you a favor . do you get it now ?
yep , yep , yep . you want to go back home with okja , right ?
then do as you &apos;re told .
otherwise , this is what will happen to okja .
put it on .
the turnout &apos;s looking good , don &apos;t you think ?
- lucy must be thrilled . - yeah .
tell me about it .
- all the eyes on her .
- she thinks it &apos;s her own fashion show .
mija .
it &apos;s me .
jay .
shut up !
man , this is so good , man . you gotta try this .
it &apos;s actually really good .
good day , all . thank you very much .
these are for you .
thanks , frank .
ten years . an extraordinary accomplishment .
ten years , finally coming to fruition .
you have to try one of these . they &apos;re completely delicious .
delicious .
beautiful .
such a shame we had to tell all those little white lies .
it &apos;s not our fault that the consumers are so paranoid about gm foods .
these are really beautiful .
your taste is as impeccable as always .
well , the flowers aren &apos;t actually from me .
- are they from nancy ?
- yes .
and nancy &apos;s here . not in london .
she &apos;s here ?
in new york ?
fuck nancy .
- she &apos;s been here a while .
- i told you to keep her away !
she frightens people !
you frighten people , too , lucy .
yeah , but she really frightens people . she reminds them of daddy .
this is mine . this is my project .
she just wants to support you on your special day .
is she watching me ?
johnny &apos;s in the house !
yes !
johnny !
yeah !
johnny !
dr. johnny &apos;s ...
magical animals !
everybody knows dr. johnny can &apos;t stand anything boring !
no !
- have i ever given you a boring show ?
who &apos;s ready ?
ten years ago , twenty-six farmers from lands far away were each given a magical super piglet .
this year , i met these wonderful people , to decide which super piglet would have the honor of being invited to this prestigious occasion .
are you ready to meet the winner of this contest ?
yeah !
the best super pig on the face of the earth ?
yeah !
are you ready ?
well , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re gonna have to meet somebody else first .
isn &apos;t that the way it always is ?
before you meet the talent , you gotta meet the suits .
i &apos;m just kidding . i &apos;m just kidding .
she is an amazing little lady ... and she happens to be the brain behind this entire super pig project !
ladies and gentlemen , put your hands together for the one , the only ,
lucy mirando !
&quot; lucy mirando ! &quot;
fucking idiot .
you look amazing !
oh , johnny .
you &apos;re skating on thin ice . watch out you don &apos;t fall in and drown .
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m not here to put you to sleep with some corporate speech like my boring sister might have .
there it is !
hello , lucy !
lucy , we love you !
no . i &apos;m here to introduce you to a real superstar .
maybe you &apos;ve already seen her on youtube , enjoying her little shopping spree on that ... in that underground mall in seoul !
so let &apos;s all welcome an extraordinary little girl .
a local farmer who raised her beloved super pig in wild and beautiful nature .

well . good luck with clearing up my mess , twinny .
well , for a while back then , you forgot you were such a loser .
i mean , daddy was a terrible man .
he was a real horror .
but , by god , did he know about business .
don &apos;t worry about your apology speech , twinny .
i &apos;ll pretend to be you in front of the press .
the police .
you &apos;ll understand that i will be instructing our corporate attorneys not to assist you in any way .
frank .
- zero delay on the distribution plan .
- of course .
scrap lucy &apos;s precious promotional marketing crap .
- tell everyone asap .
- definitely .
we already have fda approval , correct ?
yes , we do . but i &apos;m not sure how the customers will react after today .
if it &apos;s cheap , they &apos;ll eat it .
i guarantee early sales will be strong .
shut down the lab as already discussed .
we &apos;ll visit the production facility later tonight .
get all the execs there , even the ones on vacation .
put all the pigs into production .
- even the best super pig ?
- every last one of them .
- you okay ?
- k ...

mija , are you okay ?
she wants to know where we &apos;re going .
we &apos;re going to okja .
yes , but you should know the situation is not good .

okja !
no !
don &apos;t go inside !
hey !
okja .
no !
- okja ...
- wait .
- this what caused the alarm ?
- i believe so .
i &apos;m flummoxed that security is so lax as to allow a bunch of hooligans to delay the production line , even for a second .
it won &apos;t happen again . please note that black chalk was here exactly on time .
- no , guys , guys , this is ...
- please , don &apos;t touch her !

she is . and that &apos;s our best super pig .
well , what &apos;s the hiccup ?
why is it still alive ?
why you want to kill okja ?
well , we can only sell the dead ones .
i wanna go home with okja .
no , it &apos;s my property .
- you &apos;re a fucking psychopath .
- you should be ashamed of yourself .
fuck off !
we &apos;re extremely proud of our achievements .
we &apos;re very hardworking businesspeople .
we do deals , and these are the deals we do .
this is the tenderloin for the sophisticated restaurants .
the mexicans love the feet . i know . go figure !
we all love the face and the anus , as american as apple pie !
hot dogs .

mom and me versus you and dad .
-long .
-that looked pretty good .
-lt was out .
-lt did look good .
-frank , it was out .
-it &apos;s my call . out .
if you can , try and hit it at your mother &apos;s backhand .
-it &apos;s pretty weak .
-got it .
-yes ! .
-don &apos;t gloat , walt .
five games to three , us .
-fuck ! come on , bernard .
-bernard , don &apos;t curse .
i &apos;m cursing at myself .
-nice shot .
-thanks .
-walt , watch out .
-it &apos;s part of the game .
fifteen-love .
joan , i &apos;m sorry . it was an accident .
you gotta get a second serve .
frank .
did you just put that peanut up your nose ?
cashew . yes .
pickle , that is such an idiotic , stupid thing to do .
no , it &apos;s out . i got it .
we &apos;re reading a tale of two cities in english . is that any good ?
it &apos;s minor dickens . popular in schools .
but i think david copperfield or great expectations is much richer .
what is it about high school that you read all the worst books by good writers ?
you should read it and see what you think of it .
i don &apos;t wanna waste my time .
what are you doing ?
just fixing up the couch .
-did you sleep there ?
-yeah , our bed is hurting my back .
isn &apos;t the couch worse than the bed ? for backs ?
no . this is better .
when does mom &apos;s story come out in the magazine ?
it &apos;s not a magazine . it &apos;s a literary journal .
next month , i think .
it &apos;ll be weird having two writers as parents .
yeah , well , dad influenced her . she never wrote before she met him .
i haven &apos;t read any of dad &apos;s books .
i &apos;ve looked at them . they &apos;re great . very dense .
he needs a new agent . it &apos;s been too long .
the publishing world isn &apos;t receptive always to real literary talent .
maybe mom will be famous instead .
-no , dad &apos;s the writer .
-maybe mom &apos;s better .
that &apos;s way off base , frank . that &apos;s way off base .
ivan hit with arthur ashe once .
wasn &apos;t he ranked , like , 402 or something ?
ivan could &apos;ve been a champ if he hadn &apos;t hurt his knee .
okay , my brother , let &apos;s see some groundstrokes .
you gotta ease up , my brother .
jimmy connors hits as hard as he can but we can &apos;t all get away with that , right ?
all right , let &apos;s see the backhand .
two hands . two hands . hey , my brother .
who taught you these junkyard strokes ?
my dad . he &apos;s self-taught .
i heard that . hey , bernard .
you teaching my brother here these junkyard chip shots ?
a one-handed backhand is an elegant stroke .
my brother here doesn &apos;t want a weak chip shot for a backhand .
-i don &apos;t care .
-it &apos;s mcenroe &apos;s stroke .
he &apos;s the master of the chip game .
-all right , fellas , that &apos;s it for today .
-ivan , you wanna hit a little ?
i got a few minutes .
frank , you and carl hang out . give me your racquet .
-are you interested in any arts ?
-i wouldn &apos;t mind being a pro .
it &apos;s very hard to be a professional player .
as good as even ivan is , he &apos;s not in a league with mcenroe or connors .
oh , i don &apos;t mean a pro like that .
i mean , like a pro at the bubble . like ivan .
you don &apos;t wanna be a pro .
i &apos;m sure i &apos;ve lost my parking space . we &apos;re gonna have to drive around .
-can you drop me off ?
-no .
i picked you up , the least you can do is ride around with me .
terrific , honeys .
-walt , did you write that song ?
-yes .
-frank had some good ideas too . -very dense .
very interesting .
yeah . i signed up for the talent thing they have at school .
great . just make sure you practice a lot .
mom , i &apos;ll be fine .
remember , you &apos;ll be in front of a lot of people .
-don &apos;t ruin the whole thing for me .
if you don &apos;t , something &apos;s wrong with them .
which is probably the case , actually . people can be very stupid .
i &apos;ll get it .
walt , you wanna come to my class tomorrow after school ?
-yeah .
-could i come ?
you have tennis . you &apos;re gonna be doing that , which is its own thing .
-look how young dad looks .
-that &apos;s funny . dad , can i have this ?
-okay .
-would you write something in it ?
thanks .
&quot; l absorb sex indiscriminately , numb and impartial .
i suck men of their interiors .
a fuck that unites john , dan , scott , whomever in the popular lust and paternal hunt for my possession .
he was a large man , though his arms were thin .
the upper part soft , but not fleshy . like a young woman &apos;s .
he had long , delicate fingers and plump palms similar to a raccoon &apos;s .
with finesse , he plied the meat from a crab claw and sucked oysters from their shells . &quot;
she &apos;s a very risky writer , lili . very racy .
i mean , exhibiting her cunt in that fashion is very racy .
lili has her influences in postmodern literature , a bit derivative of kafka .
but for a student , very racy .
-did you get that it was her cunt ?
-oh , yeah .
-did you like it ?
-yeah . a lot .
you &apos;d like kafka , one of my predecessors .
-particularly the metamorphosis .
-metamorphosis ?
no fucking spaces .
-i &apos;ll keep you company while we look .
-thank you .
dad , what were your wives like before mom ?
&quot; wife , &quot; really . the first one was annulled .
-i was 1 9 .
-what was she like ?
-the annulled one ?
-no , the one you &apos;d call a wife .
difficult .
that &apos;s mom .
yeah , that &apos;s mom .
what was she wearing ?
no , i guess i &apos;ve seen that before .
what are you writing ?
i &apos;m working on the peugeot story .
did you take my note about the ending ?
-some of it .
-does he still die ?
-yeah .
-then you didn &apos;t take my note .
boys , make sure you come home right after school .
-why ?
-we &apos;re having a family conference .
-what &apos;s that ?
-a talk . just come home .
-what about ?
-we &apos;ll go over it tonight .
-can &apos;t you give us a hint ?
-no , just- - tonight .
_removed_
just waiting for your mother .
-mom .
-sorry .
-okay .
-okay . all set ?
yes .
okay .
your mom and i ....
okay , yeah . mom and i are going ....
we &apos;re going to separate .
you &apos;re not gonna be leaving either of us .
we &apos;re gonna have joint custody . frank , it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;ve got an elegant new house across the park .
across the park ?
-ls that even brooklyn ?
-it &apos;s only five stops on the subway .
it &apos;s an elegant block . the fillet of the neighborhood .
-we &apos;ll have a ping-pong table .
-i don &apos;t play ping-pong .
-we &apos;ll both see you equally .
-we &apos;re splitting up the week .
i love you . i wanna see you as much as your mom does .
-but there &apos;s seven days .
-right .
how will you split evenly with seven days ?
i &apos;ve got you tuesday , wednesday and saturday and every other thursday .
-every other ?
-that &apos;s how we each have you equally .
that was your father &apos;s idea .
-don &apos;t do this .
-how will we get to school ?
there &apos;s a subway four blocks from the house .
four or five . no more than six blocks .
and what about the cat ?
-shit , the cat .
-we didn &apos;t discuss the cat .
your father will pick him up on those days when you switch houses .
i &apos;ll drive here two more times a week ?
you got a place on the other side of the park .
if it was near here , it wouldn &apos;t be a problem .
this neighborhood got expensive .
it &apos;s painful for me to stay in this neighborhood . don &apos;t be difficult . i feel banished .
oh , pickle .
-dad , what will happen with the cat ?
-we &apos;ll figure something out .
is it because dad isn &apos;t as successful as he used to be ?
now that you &apos;re publishing and he isn &apos;t , is that it ?
-that &apos;s not nice to say .
-this is a great family .
why are you screwing it up ?
-lf we could avoid it , i would .
-you &apos;ve been together 1 6 years .
-seventeen .
i can &apos;t imagine living like this .
don &apos;t most of your friends already have divorced parents ?
yeah , but i don &apos;t .
well , now you do .
-i think you &apos;re doing a foolish thing .
-i understand how unhappy you are .
i &apos;m unhappy too .
_removed_
it has nothing to do with you .
it &apos;s okay . go back to sleep .
-are those your books ? -yes .
these are my books .
why are they going under my bed ?
because i bought them , and i don &apos;t wanna lose them .
we &apos;ll put them back on the shelf when your father leaves .
until things are certain , we shouldn &apos;t say anything to anyone yet .
-why ?
-because we never know .
and i don &apos;t want people to know our business .
i told carl .
-already ?
-i called him last night .
i also told matt and dale .
and dale ?
shit , now everyone will know . jesus , frank .
-mom says we should tell people .
-mom doesn &apos;t go to school .
stop crying .
-joint custody blows .
-i was told it &apos;s better .
it &apos;s miserable . my parents didn &apos;t wanna uproot me and rebecca .
so we stayed in the house . they took separate apartments and switched off coming to us .
then my mom met dexter .
my dad freaked out .
and then they sold the house , and i go back and forth anyway .
god , joint custody blows .
thanks . yeah , i forgot to take these . she has a few of my books still .
she wrote her maiden name in them when she knew we were splitting .
but these were mine .
-are you and walt stealing from mom ?
-these were mine , frank .
watch it ! jesus !
hey , brother . walt .
bernard , joan says you have a check for me .
she said that ?
no , tennis is hers .
our separation agreement says she handles tennis and winter coats .
-i do sneakers and camp . -okay .
i &apos;ll take it up with her .
walt .
ivan &apos;s a bit of a half-wit , isn &apos;t he ?
it was important to me to have a place like your mother &apos;s .
i &apos;m gonna cook and run the household like you &apos;re used to .
-this is nothing like our house .
-you mean , your mother &apos;s house .
-what ?
-this isn &apos;t like your mother &apos;s house .
-that &apos;s what i said .
-you said , &quot; our house . &quot;
that &apos;s your mother &apos;s house . this is your house too .
-no , this is your house .
-it &apos;s our house .
i hate nastase . you know that . ivan met nastase and said he was an asshole .
-well , i couldn &apos;t find vitas gerulaitis .
-i have a vitas poster at home .
at mom &apos;s . and all my turtles .
we can get some turtles . i know you like amphibians .
turtles are reptiles .
here &apos;s a desk for you to do your homework .
dad , this is for a lefty .
dad got me a lefty desk .
don &apos;t be difficult . we need to be supportive of dad .
-i hate it here .
-don &apos;t be a chick .
-you can get a righty desk later .
-why do i want a desk at home ?
i don &apos;t want a chalkboard or a bell going off every 45 minutes either .
-he likes being with us .
-he likes having us in the house .
you got books . i didn &apos;t get books .
because these are the books dad knows i like .
-i wanna go back to mom &apos;s .
-why ? she caused this , chick .
-i &apos;m not &quot; chick . &quot;
-yes , you are .
-chick , this is mom &apos;s doing .
-stop calling me chick !
mom told us they &apos;d never get divorced . so mom &apos;s a liar .
fuck ! that hurt !
i &apos;m not being a chick , you fucking ass man .
you &apos;re hurting me , really hurting me .
one turtle would &apos;ve made a difference .
you live in park slope , right ?
my mom does . and i do sometimes .
i live on the other side of the park half the time .
-prospect heights ?
-i &apos;m not sure .
the street &apos;s stratford road . my dad &apos;s moving there .

-you like franz kafka ?
-i don &apos;t know him .
he &apos;s great . the metamorphosis is a masterpiece .
-sounds good .
-yeah , it is .
-have you read this side of paradise ?
-no , but it &apos;s minor fitzgerald .
-ls it ?
i loved it .
-it &apos;s a minor work .
gatsby is his masterpiece . and tender is the night is dazzling .
last tycoon , had he finished it ....
i hope you like it . your notes were awesome , bernard .
i loved your idea for the change in tense at the end .
it could be the coup of the story .
i reread a hunger artist on your suggestion and stole a couple things .
-see if you can spot them .
-good story to steal from .
-fuck !
-frank .
sorry .
how long were you and mom not getting along ?
a couple of years . i thought we would work it out .
i wanted to . i tried . as you know , i tried very hard .
-your mother wasn &apos;t interested in that .
-why not ? -i think it has very little to do with me .
-shit !
fucker ! -frank !
-she could never make up her mind .
she &apos;d pull away and then get angry at me for not being more aggressive .
her affair with richard made it difficult for me to save the marriage .
it became a fait accompli . -affair ?
-with richard .
-who &apos;s richard ?
-a man from the neighborhood .
i think she met him at one of frank &apos;s little league games .
a shrink . seems sort of like an ordinary guy . not an intellectual .
-how long was she having the affair ?
-about four years .
-you &apos;re kidding .
-no . i thought you knew this .
no . no .
fuck that cock shit !
frank , you gotta relax , my brother .
-hey , mom .
-hey , honeys .
-what are you doing ?
-just changing things around a bit .
i &apos;ve come by to tell you i &apos;m not staying here anymore .
-why ?
-you know why .
-i don &apos;t .
-frank , do you know why ?
-no .
-why don &apos;t you tell me ?
because you cheated on dad .
how did you hear that ?
-your father told you .
-yeah , he told me .
why did you , mom ?
i was having a hard time .
where were we during this ?
did you bring men home ?
not while- - not ....
not when your father was in town .
you actually met richard , both you boys .
he came over for takeout once .
you talked about the stones .
oh , god . under our noses . like a brothel .
men coming in and out . -shut up .
-lf you want me to explain , i will .
-i don &apos;t wanna hear it .
-i do . walt doesn &apos;t , so i won &apos;t say anything .
-walt can leave .
-you disgust me .
you weren &apos;t even a writer until recently .
you bailed on dad because he &apos;s not successful and hasn &apos;t got recognition .
-you sound like your father .
-i &apos;m glad . you disgust me .
you &apos;re being a shit , walt .
-i &apos;m taking the cat .
-you can &apos;t have him . it &apos;s his night here .
okay , you can kiss me now .
no , the moment &apos;s ruined .
-i &apos;ll go sneak up and surprise chrissy .
-it &apos;s not her birthday .
she also had an affair with some therapist .
-i don &apos;t wanna know .
-and otto &apos;s father , don .
-otto &apos;s father ?
-yeah , but it &apos;s over .
she said the affairs have been miserable for her .
she &apos;s dating now , but nothing serious .
she &apos;s crazy . she should keep her affairs to herself .
-i &apos;m not going back .
-you have to , joint custody .
fuck joint custody .
-ls mom letting you drink soda ?
-beer .
-since when do you drink beer ?
-since recently .
you think don and she did it ?
-i don &apos;t wanna think about it .
-lmagine don &apos;s dick in mom &apos;s mouth .
-who are you ?
stop it . -do you think they do that ?
-you think she gets anal sex from don ?
-stop , okay .
it &apos;s disgusting .
don &apos;t .
-we have the same bone structure .
you have your dad &apos;s features .
really ?
-fuck it .
-frank .
-i thought i had your bone structure .
you &apos;re ugly .
pickle , why would you say that ?
because i think it &apos;s true . i think carl thinks you &apos;re ugly .
i &apos;m not though , sweetie .
-i found out something last night .
-what &apos;s that ?
that your dad was fucking my mom .
-what ?
-you heard me .
supposedly going on for a year or so about two years ago .
-i &apos;m so horrified by this .
-thanks .
no , i don &apos;t mean by your mom . she &apos;s very attractive .
it was just an affair . a fuck . we &apos;re not gonna be brothers .
she said your dad &apos;s pretty fucked up with women .
why &apos;d she sleep with him then ?
i don &apos;t know .
because she &apos;s an asshole .
i read the metamorphosis . you were right , it &apos;s great .
yeah . so bizarre . what do you think is happening at the end , with the sister ?
yeah , i think she &apos;s ....
-i mean , it &apos;s ambiguous , really .
-yeah .
i mean , it &apos;s gross when he turns into a bug but i love how matter-of-fact everything is .
yeah , it &apos;s very kafkaesque .
-because it &apos;s written by franz kafka .
-right .
-no , i mean , clearly .
-lt would have to be .
you &apos;re shoving the whole tongue in me .
no , it &apos;s okay . just do it a little-- like , little licks .
-like this ?
-yeah .
i wish you didn &apos;t have so many freckles on your face .
not really , though .
i &apos;m feeling kind of feverish .
-do we have any tylenol ?
-i don &apos;t know .
-i didn &apos;t see any .
-then there isn &apos;t any .
can we get some ?
-ls this enough ?
-get a small one .
_removed_
-i don &apos;t have enough money .
-i got it .
-you have any change ?
wanna play ping-pong ?
-i &apos;m gonna lie down .
-one game .
-fucking shit .
-nineteen-7 .
have you given more thought to what you &apos;re interested in ?
come on .
you have to try . it &apos;s no fun for me if you don &apos;t try .
-i wanna be a tennis pro like ivan .
-you don &apos;t wanna be a tennis pro .
-why not ?
-it &apos;s not serious .
i mean , mcenroe . borg is an artist . it &apos;s like dance .
connors has a brilliance . but at ivan &apos;s level ....
ivan is fine , but he &apos;s not a serious guy .
-he &apos;s a philistine .
-what &apos;s a philistine ?
it &apos;s a guy who doesn &apos;t care about books or interesting films and things .
your mother &apos;s brother ned is also a philistine .
-then i &apos;m a philistine .
you &apos;re interested in books and things . liked the wild child when we saw it .
lots of people liked that movie .
no , i &apos;m a philistine .
when am i going to meet the famous sophie ?
i don &apos;t know . she &apos;s not gorgeous , but she &apos;s cute .
you have plenty of time to sleep with gorgeous women .
goddamn it !
they fell on the floor .
when my first novel came out , i had a lot of opportunities .
i was with your mother , so i didn &apos;t partake .
i &apos;ve never had an affair with a student , though many have come on to me .
that &apos;s why you might not wanna be attached at your age .
it sounds like sophie &apos;s good for now .
-why &apos;d you yell , &quot; goddamn it &quot; ?
-i burned myself .
the cutlets are great . dad , did you hear from that agent ?
-not yet .
-but if he likes your novel ...
- ... then you get it published .
-basically .
what happened to your old agent , fred ?
he pissed me off .
made a disparaging remark about the knicks at a party .
said they played like thugs . i found it offensive .
he &apos;s kind of a jerk .
it was important to your mother that i achieve some sort of commercial success .
and when i didn &apos;t meet her expectations in that area ....
you &apos;re going to witness a greenberg family tradition .
friday night chinese at hunan palace . i hope you &apos;re prepared .
-hey .
-hey .
why &apos;d you let go of my hand ?
-what ?
-when we passed wendy , you let go .
i didn &apos;t realize .
walt , anything you &apos;d like to order ?
i &apos;m happy to have the same amount of dishes as people .
it &apos;s always one dish less the number of people .
that &apos;s our family tradition , not ordering enough food .
-that &apos;s funny . oh , he &apos;s funny , sophie .
-i know .
-you &apos;re early .
-hi , joan .
-don &apos;t feed him the generic stuff .
-what ?
frank says you &apos;re feeding the cat generic food .
get purina , it &apos;s what he likes .
-it &apos;s the same damn thing .
-it &apos;s not , but--
he &apos;s my cat too .
remember when he got stuck in a wall in new hampshire and i rescued him ?
-i know how to handle him .
-lt was a radiator .
-what ?
-he got stuck in a radiator .
you trimmed your beard .
yeah , it was starting to get a little feral .
-you look well .
-yeah ?
-thanks .
-things are good here .
teaching is going well .
and i &apos;m playing the best tennis of my life .
maybe that &apos;s an illusion but it feels that way .
that &apos;s good .
i was thinking we should sit together at walt &apos;s performance next month .
-okay .
-lt &apos;d be nice for him if we &apos;re both there together .
maybe we could all go out afterwards .
i don &apos;t know . maybe .
okay , maybe .
i think he &apos;s getting good at guitar .
i know .
the stuff he &apos;s writing is really wonderful .
-have you met his girlfriend ?
-no . he talks about her ...
_removed_
i &apos;d appreciate it if you didn &apos;t tell him about things like richard .
my father told me you called him .
i did , yeah .
he said you ....
-he said you were upset .
-yeah .
i wanted to ....
i like him .
you know that .
i just wanted to say-- i don &apos;t know .
i just wanted to say hello .
he called me right after . he said :
&quot; bernie , i think you can save your marriage . &quot;
i told him i didn &apos;t think there was anything else i could do .
i did try everything .
bye , bernard .
bernard ?
i was wondering if you knew of any apartments .
i &apos;m being kicked out of my sublet .
unless i , i don &apos;t know , blow the super , i &apos;m out on my ass .
oh , i don &apos;t . no .
i guess you don &apos;t know either , huh ?
no .
i have an extra room in my house . you could stay till you find something .
you wouldn &apos;t have to blow your super .
i guess ....
-i &apos;d hate to put you out .
-no , no .
-or your kids .
-no . no .
the mother and the whore .
-looks like a cool movie .
-a classic .
-i had it in my room .
-bathroom is across the hall .
you &apos;ll share with the kids . they can use mine .
i don &apos;t care . as long as walt remembers to put the seat down .
thank you , bernard . thank you , walt .
-joan says you don &apos;t like your sheets .
-they &apos;re fine .
and you disapprove of the food i feed the cat .
you should tell me these things , not her .
-fuck !
_removed_
fifteen-20 .
-motherfucker !
-my serve .
-i wasn &apos;t ready .
-yes , you were .
frank , i was not ready .
this is mother hubbard . there is nothing to eat or drink . no soda .
-we &apos;re not allowed soda .
-goddamn it !
i guess there &apos;s two kinds of parents :
those who allow soda and sugar cereal , and those who don &apos;t .
we &apos;re not supposed to use paper towels to wipe our hands . cloth is for that .
you &apos;re cute .
thanks .
i don &apos;t believe this shit .
-shit !
-good game .
it &apos;s hard to beat your father .
-watch it !
-suck my dick , ass man .
-where you going ?
-the movies .
and then to a party with sophie .
-what are you gonna do ?
-i don &apos;t know .
frank won &apos;t leave his room . he &apos;s being difficult .
you wanna come to the movie ?
okay .
not the party , but the movie .
so we were thinking short circuit .
blue velvet is supposed to be quite interesting .
i love you ! love me !
he put his disease in me .
tell me it &apos;s all right . i opened myself to you .
no .
stop , frank .
no .
a student of mine writes very racy short stories you might like .
she has one that chronicles her vagina .
-dad .
-that sounds interesting .
very feminist , but very interesting .
frank , i &apos;m back .
frank ?
frank ?
-what were you doing ?
-i was going to mom &apos;s .
you don &apos;t do that on my night . ever . you hear me ?
-yes .
-i &apos;m your father .
you listen to what i say .
-but you were out .
-it &apos;s still my night , damn it .
okay , okay .
shit ! someone &apos;s taken my space .
-goddamn it . son of a bitch .
-sorry .
frank !
hello ?
hello ?
frank , what are you doing here ?
it &apos;s not your night with me .
-i don &apos;t wanna look like dad .
-looks aren &apos;t everything .
it &apos;s not your night with me , sweetie .
-did you have a party ?
-i celebrated .
knopf is publishing my novel . pickle , you should be at your dad &apos;s .
-yeah ?
-yeah .
i need some nights without you guys sometimes .
what &apos;s up , brother ?
nothing .
hello ?
he just took off and went to your mother &apos;s . it &apos;s my night , he knows that .
you think we could ease up on whose night is whose ?
i wanna see you guys . i love you .
did you like sophie ?
yeah . i think she &apos;s fine . is she a knicks fan ?
i don &apos;t know .
-you think she &apos;s pretty ?
-sure , yeah .
but she &apos;s not the type i go for .
you just have to decide if you wanna be attached .
it &apos;s good to play the field at your age .
lili is pretty .
would you go ring the bell ?
i hate walking up those steps .
it &apos;s very uncomfortable for me . very painful .
i used to live in this house .
as you know .
your dad and walt are here . they &apos;re gonna take you back to bernard &apos;s .
-i &apos;ll be right out .
-i &apos;m sorry about--
i &apos;m sorry about your seeing ivan like this .
i would &apos;ve liked to have told you before you saw him .
your mother .
i wanted to talk about ivan so you don &apos;t hear it from anyone else .
frank may have already said something .
yeah , he did .
i &apos;ve been seeing him a short time .
but i like him .
and i thought you guys should know that .
-and do you have any questions ?
-no .
there was something else i was gonna say .
i ran into celia , lance &apos;s mother , on the street and she was telling me how wonderful she thinks you are .
how polite and funny and ....
she said you did something with the salt and pepper shakers .
-a little play or something ? -yeah .
it was kind of stupid .
i said , &quot; l already know all those things about him . but it &apos;s nice to hear it . &quot;
i remember what else i was gonna say .
i wanted to know if you &apos;d be interested in coming to dinner saturday .
no . i &apos;m going to a party on saturday . i &apos;m sleeping at jeffrey &apos;s .
-that &apos;s okay .
-i &apos;m gonna go to bed .
okay . good night , chicken .
night .
-you think she likes you ?
-i get a feeling , yeah .
-what about sophie ?
-lf i can lose it to lili , i &apos;ll do it .
i mean , i bet she &apos;s great in bed .
she can probably move her pussy muscles the right way ...
- ... so you blow your load in seconds . -yeah .
it &apos;d be pretty great .
maybe do them both . why not ?
hey , brother .
how &apos;s the grip ?
-do you think you and i are philistines ?
-frank .
what &apos;s a philistine ?
someone who doesn &apos;t like books or interesting movies or things .
-you &apos;re still here . it &apos;s my night .
-i know .
i just thought i &apos;d watch him hit .
you married ?
no .
the whole thing &apos;s very complicated .
mom &apos;s dating ivan .
really ?
-ivan , back there ivan ?
-yeah .
are you sure ?
why didn &apos;t you say something ?
why is your mother dating all these jocks ?
-very uninteresting men .
-ivan is very interesting .
ivan &apos;s not a serious possibility for your mother .
i think he is .
i don &apos;t wanna badmouth ivan .
but i don &apos;t know what joan is thinking .
-i think lvan--
-frank .
-sorry . is that too hard ?
-yeah , a bit . a bit .
is that better ?
yeah .
yeah . that &apos;s good . that &apos;s--
i guess ....
i don &apos;t know what ....
-why that happened .
-oh , it &apos;s okay . yeah .
-it &apos;s okay .
-okay .
-shit . sorry .
-don &apos;t be sorry .
i don &apos;t know why i didn &apos;t last . i usually go longer .
it &apos;s okay . i guess i can take it as a compliment .
did you take your shirt off for nelson barton ?
-i don &apos;t wanna talk about it , walt .
-it &apos;s important .
-why is it important ?
-i need to know what happened .
well , he felt me up , and i touched him .
-down his pants ?
-walt , yeah .
i just ....
from what i could tell , not an intellectual .
i &apos;m a virgin .
so am i .
-when &apos;s your next book coming out ?
-soon , i hope . soon .
-who &apos;s publishing it ?
-well , i &apos;m looking for a new agent first .
a friend of mine &apos;s an agent with binky urban .
-lf you like , i &apos;ll show it to him .
-oh , that &apos;d be great .
hello ?
-could i stay the night at sophie &apos;s ?
-thanks for doing that .
okay , i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .

-you don &apos;t need me home for anything ? -no .
everything &apos;s fine .
if you &apos;re interested , walt and i are taking a road trip to suny binghamton in a couple of weekends .
_removed_
and an ex-student of mine , now friend jeb gelber , is feting me with a dinner .
excellent .
you should read the cathedral scene from underwater .
i &apos;ve done that one a lot . i thought i &apos;d do something new .
but okay , well , maybe .
sorry , my nose is running .
i &apos;m your teacher .
i &apos;ve wondered for a long time what it &apos;d be like to fuck you .
i think we should wait .
really ?
yeah . yeah , let &apos;s wait .
okay , up next , walt berkman who is going to play us a song .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to play lead guitar and do vocals on a song i wrote .
-that song was so good !
-thank you .
oh , dad , you remember sophie .
-and lili .
-hi .
-how much did you win ?
-hundred bucks .
come by my room tonight before you go to bed .
-i wanna show you something .
-okay .
and this is my mom and frank and ivan .
hi .
-some song , brother .
-thanks .
hey , bernard .
i thought we &apos;d have dinner .
ivan suggested gage tollner . we &apos;d celebrate my book and your song .
-i &apos;m gonna go with dad .
-well , your dad and i ...
- ... talked about all of us going .
-i don &apos;t wanna do that . see you .
ivan and i came to see your show . don &apos;t treat us that way .
you think you hate me , but i know you don &apos;t .
where &apos;d you come up with those lyrics ?
they were very dreamlike .
reminds me of my second novel , end of the line .
-a rock-star character in that .
-i love that novel .
classic . scenes with the baby in the middle are based on me as a baby .
right . it &apos;s mailer &apos;s favorite of my books .
and i loved your wife &apos;s piece in the new yorker .
really ? in the new yorker ?
-did you know about this ?
-i guess i did .
-how &apos;d that happen ?
-it &apos;s an excerpt .
-she &apos;s getting a novel published .
-really ?
walt showed it to me . it was kind of sad , but really good .
the portions are very big here . you only need half an order .
okay .
jesus , $ 1 5 for parking .
what do you think i should do about sophie ?
you &apos;ll make the right decision .
i regret sometimes i wasn &apos;t more of a free agent when i was younger .
a woman approached me at a party at george plimpton &apos;s after my first book .
she was very sexy . i could &apos;ve gone home with her .
why didn &apos;t you ?
-i was with your mother .
-oh , right , of course .
you should &apos;ve probably done it . it didn &apos;t stop her .
maybe you should sleep with her once . see if you like it .
it doesn &apos;t mean you can &apos;t see other women too .
i don &apos;t know if sophie will go for that .
well , after your performance tonight , things might change for you .
-wanna go to my house ?
we could--
-jesus !
-you really wanna do it , don &apos;t you ?
-i don &apos;t know .
-what &apos;s the obsession with sex ?
-it &apos;s not an obsession .
i &apos;m not so sure i wanna do it either . i &apos;m scared too .
scared is not the issue . everything is so serious suddenly .
-we &apos;re not getting married .
-what are you saying ?
nothing . i don &apos;t wanna feel this pressure .
do you like someone else ?
your dad &apos;s girlfriend ?
no . no . why ... ?
no . and she &apos;s not his girlfriend .
my dad said you had a weak handshake , a sign of indecision .
his hands are huge , i can &apos;t get a good grip .
my mom said you don &apos;t have a good model for relationships ... - ... because of your parents .
-what ?
your mother doesn &apos;t know anything .
i thought it went well . you told me she said i was hilarious .
don &apos;t be difficult . please .
you want a beer ?
i couldn &apos;t take relying on your dad &apos;s shopping habits anymore .
you can have anything you want whenever .
thanks .
i &apos;m gonna read you a draft of my new story .
i wanna hear your thoughts first . then i &apos;m gonna show it to your dad .
you like pink floyd , huh ?
-what ?
-don &apos;t worry .
i used to hand in lou reed lyrics in my poetry class and pass them off as my own .
although i hope you don &apos;t get caught . i always did .
do you-- ?
-fuck !
-sorry .
-shit !
-lili , sorry .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s just a ....
-it &apos;s just a bloody nose .
-i &apos;m sorry .
-i might take a bath , okay ?
-oh , okay .
_removed_
-hey .
-hey .
-when &apos;s bernard coming to get you ?
-ln an hour .
plan on 30 minutes . he &apos;s always early to get you .
and late to bring you back .
-i wish i could come with you guys .
-i heard that .
i know . but dad &apos;s got you on saturdays .
-do you like his girlfriend ?
-ls she his girlfriend ?
i thought so . she lives with you .
-he doesn &apos;t say ?
-no .
i think walt loves her .
-so they like the same women now too .
-what ?
it &apos;s nothing . you got our number in maine . remember to lock up .
i will .
-see you next week , pickle-oo .
-just pickle , please .
i &apos;ll see you next week , just pickle .
-good grip , brother .
-you too , brother .
dad , it &apos;s me .
are you there ?
pick up .
-how are you ?
-good to see you .
i &apos;m sorry about the turnout . kids go home early for passover .
they seemed to like it .
i mean , masturbating is his own issue .
but hector witnessed the locker incident and then later , semen was found in the library .
who &apos;s hector ?
how do you know they were both frank &apos;s ?
well , i suppose it &apos;s possible other kids are masturbating and spreading their semen around the school as well .
it &apos;s possible , but somewhat unlikely .
oh , it happens , i &apos;m sure , more than we know .
bernard , have you ever done anything like this ?
i &apos;m not going to answer that .
has anything been going on at home that might &apos;ve provoked this behavior ?
well , bernard left him behind for three days last week .
of course , frank &apos;s mother divorced me earlier this year .
which also might have something to do with it .
ms. berkman , i read your story in the new yorker .
-i thought it was quite moving .
-thanks .
thanks a lot .
you &apos;re living with a 20-year-old .
-it &apos;s none of your business .
-lt is when you have our kids .
it &apos;s confusing for them .
frank says wait &apos;s in love with her .
walt has a girlfriend .
fuck off , joan .
i don &apos;t ask about you and ivan . stay out of my life .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;d talk to me like this .
you left all those fucking ticket stubs and letters lying around .
you wanted me to know .
it was fucking torture , joan .
fucking torture .
he made his own interpretation .
he &apos;s still gonna have to give the prize money back .
but obviously it &apos;s a bigger problem . he isn &apos;t doing his schoolwork either .
his paper on gatsby was quite brilliant , i thought .
it &apos;s one of his favorite books .
that may be , but i don &apos;t believe he &apos;s read it .
you both should talk to him .
i think bernard has to do it .
he wants you to see a therapist .
-i don &apos;t need that .
-that &apos;s what i said .
does simic know both your parents have ph.d. &apos; s in literature ?
-i mentioned it .
-i think he &apos;s full of shit .
these public schools tend to hire well-meaning but ultimately ...
- ... unsophisticated bureaucrats .
-yeah . i don &apos;t like him .
but you might have to do it . just to please the school .
-i don &apos;t need it .
-i know .
and unfortunately , probably a guy with a ba in psychology .
not a real shrink .
i have an ma in developmental psychology ...
- ... from the yale child studies program .
-did you get a ph.d. ?
no , an ma is a master &apos;s .
right .
-any thoughts about why you &apos;re here ?
-not really .
you said you wrote the song you played in assembly .
-why ?
-i don &apos;t know .
did you have a reason ?
-i felt i could &apos;ve written it .
-okay .
but you didn &apos;t .
it was written by roger waters of pink floyd .
-i think you know that .
-but i felt i could &apos;ve .
so the fact that it was already written was kind of a technicality .
i see .
i can imagine this is a little uncomfortable for you to talk about .
-i guess . it &apos;s hard to explain .
-i wonder how you &apos;re feeling right now .
i don &apos;t know .
why don &apos;t you tell me about something less uncomfortable .
like a nice memory , maybe .
isn &apos;t that a stock question for a shrink ?
yes . that &apos;s more or less how this works .
-i can &apos;t think of anything right now .
-just think .
-come on .
-just something .
meet me halfway here .
all right , let &apos;s see .
okay .
when i was around 6 , my mom and i ducked out of julie glynn &apos;s birthday party to watch robin hood together on our tv .
that sounds like a nice memory .
-i liked errol flynn .
-errol flynn .
-that &apos;s all ?
-and i was glad she let me leave the party to watch the movie .
she and i loved that movie .
it &apos;s like ....

we &apos;d look at the knight armor at the met .
the scary fish at the natural history museum .
i was always afraid of the squid and the whale fighting .
i could only look at it with my hands in front of my face .
when we &apos;d get home , after my bath , she &apos;d go through all the different things we saw that day at the museum .
and we &apos;d get to the squid and the whale , and she &apos;d describe it for me .
which was-- it was still scary but it was less scary .
anyway , it was fun . it was fun to hear about it .
did your dad live at home back then ?
-yeah , why ?
-you didn &apos;t mention him .
where was he during all of this ?
he was ....
i don &apos;t know exactly . he was ....
he was downstairs , maybe .
he didn &apos;t ever come to the museum . this was before my brother was born .
it was before ....
it was earlier .
hello ?
hello ?
-not now , bernard .
-why not ?
i &apos;m just not , okay ?
-put me in your mouth .
-walt !
-hi .
-hey , walt .
hi .
i &apos;ll be right out . we can hang out .
-hi . is walt here ?
-no .
i &apos;d like you to come to my house .
-lsn &apos;t it mom &apos;s night ?
-yeah , but i &apos;d like you to come over .
i have to put on my shoes .
come in , i guess .
-place looks different .
-she got some new furniture in maine .
that was my tv . i bought that tv .
that &apos;s my jude the obscure .
-wanna take it ?
-no .
she still has some of the books you wrote .
dad , why are you taking me to your house on mom &apos;s night ?
just a minute .
hi .
frank let me in . i didn &apos;t realize you were here .
-i &apos;m here . it &apos;s monday .
-i &apos;d like to take him for just tonight .
i &apos;ll give you two thursdays in a row or something .
-mom .
-it &apos;s my night . he wants to stay .
be careful . that &apos;s an antique .
-where &apos;s walt ?
-i don &apos;t know where walt is .
he &apos;s not up there . bernard !
he doesn &apos;t come here .
you should go . you &apos;ll see him tomorrow .
tell walt to call me .
i dunked my head in that pond in the park .
the one near the zoo ?
oh , sweetie , that &apos;s filthy .
i hope you didn &apos;t drink any of it .
some may have gotten in my mouth . i tried not to swallow .
i shouldn &apos;t have broken up with sophie .
-why did you ?
-i thought i could do better .
better how ?
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s good . you miss her .
but i don &apos;t see myself as a person who is in this situation . i just don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t see myself this way .
well , this is how it is .
did you ever love dad ?
because if you didn &apos;t , why did you ever marry him ?
if you were gonna leave , why put us through this ?
it wasn &apos;t planned . when we first met , he was unlike anyone .
in columbus , there was no one like your dad .
i had had an affair with a man before your father .
he worked at the bookstore . we made love in the stockroom .
mom , i don &apos;t wanna hear about your affairs , please .
i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t know what i can say to you .
you say things in a way that i don &apos;t wanna hear them .
i know , chicken .
it &apos;s something i do . it &apos;s a bad habit .
do you remember when we watched robin hood ?
-he knocked on my window .
-bernard , what are you doing ?
joan , let me ask you something .
the work i did at the end of our marriage making dinners , being attentive .
-you were leaving .
-you never made a dinner .
i made burgers when you had pneumonia .
-only after i insisted .
-lf i had made more dinners ...
- ... would that have made a difference ?
-i was ready to leave long ago .
i just didn &apos;t know it then .
i &apos;ve been giving it some thought . you called my father at the last minute .
whatever you said , he thought i could save the marriage .
you felt i wasn &apos;t aggressive enough . i &apos;ll make more of an effort to do stuff .
i &apos;ve been cooking and doing chores at my house .
i make veal cutlets , which the boys love .
why don &apos;t we all have dinner and talk more about this ?
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just ....
burgers .
i &apos;ll sue you , joan . you know i will .
you had an affair for four years with that fucking shrink that ruined our marriage .
eddie goodman works on these cases . and i have an open-and-shut case .
-frank , walt , get in the car .
-sue me ?
that &apos;s-
- i can &apos;t--
you only wanted joint custody because you pay less child support that way .
because it &apos;s cheaper for you .
walt , frank !
-i don &apos;t wanna go .
-i don &apos;t give a shit ! get in the car .
-frank !
-let him stay . let him stay .
-i &apos;m just asking this one thing .
-he wants to stay .
-let him . i &apos;ll go .
-fine .
hold on .
you want him tonight ?
okay . thanks .
that &apos;s all right , my brother .
the cat !
i got him . joan , i got him .
i got him .
goddamn it .
-dad ! you see him go-- ?
-i &apos;m moving it !
fuck off .
whoa , bernard !
you all right ?
-i had him .
-joan , call an ambulance !
walt , get in the car .
what ?
it means &quot; bitch . &quot; don &apos;t you remember ?
you &apos;re calling me a bitch ?
no , don &apos;t you remember the last line of godard &apos;s a bout de souffle ?
belmondo calls seberg a bitch .
we saw it at the thalia with the dicksteins .
i got you in for the children &apos;s price . you were pregnant with walt .
like six weeks .
i still got you in for a children &apos;s ticket .
you told me you didn &apos;t like godard . you thought the jump cuts were--
i &apos;d check for the cat behind the ashcans ...
- ... under the golodners &apos; stoop !
-okay .
i didn &apos;t write it .
-i know .
-pink floyd did .
do you think we &apos;ll find him ?
i hope so .
do you think one day we could go to the galapagos ?
i don &apos;t know , pickle .
ivan and i could take you to the country on saturday to see real turtles .
saturday is dad &apos;s day .
-there &apos;s my son .
-hey .
-are you okay ?
-i &apos;m fine .
thought it was a heart attack , but i think i &apos;m just exhausted .
doctor said i &apos;m exhausted .
-too many veal cutlets ?
-maybe .
that a good book ?
oh , this is pulp . it &apos;s not serious .
it &apos;s hard to read a good book in the hospital , but this isn &apos;t bad of its kind .
leonard is the fillet of the crime genre .
i &apos;d like you to stay here for the day . i need the company .
okay .
lili moved out .
do me a favor , go out in the hall , get me another pillow .
my neck is hurting .
maybe we could even things out , and i could stay at mom &apos;s a few nights .
-i &apos;ve been staying more at yours .
-it &apos;s not a good time .
i &apos;m not gonna be 1 00 percent for a while . i &apos;d like you around .
-i don &apos;t wanna come for a while .
-it &apos;s not up to you .
you &apos;re a minor . you &apos;re in my custody . my home is your home too .
i &apos;m not coming .
why ?
that hurts my feelings .
don &apos;t be difficult .
if you like , we can get you some more posters , make your room better .
paint it a different color .
i can lend you my first edition of the naked and the dead .
as a present .
let me get you a pillow .
you used to be very emotional when you were younger .
did i look pretty silly out there , falling on the concrete ?
yeah .
what ? what are you laughing at ?
that was funny how you said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
-good comic timing .
-thanks .
why don &apos;t we get some breakfast .
see if you can find a nurse out there .
try to get the blond . she looks like a young monica vitti .

the man in that room wants to order some breakfast .
okay .

my name is oliver queen . for 5 years ,
i was stranded on an island with only one goal-- survive .
oliver queen is alive .
to do this , i must become someone else .
i must become something else .
previously on &quot; arrow &quot; ...
felicity , i want you to find out all you can about that notebook .
i &apos;ll be driving your mother around for a few days .
she &apos;s not a suspect .
oliver , something &apos;s going on in this city . you know it .
walter , please .
you &apos;ve got to stop looking into this . it &apos;s not safe .
well , accidents tend to befall people who are too curious .
and he won &apos;t be harmed ?
it &apos;s done . nor will ever discover your involvement . you have my word .
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m ready for the kind of commitment that you &apos;re looking for .
you can &apos;t be serious .
this is me serious , laurel .
call cayman fidelity .
tell them their favorite accountant is flying in to make a special deposit for a special client .
that elevator &apos;s supposed to be on a key . go .
check it out .
harold backman , you have failed this city .
i &apos;m only an accountant .
i &apos;m just the money .
the money that leads to extortion , kidnapping , and drugs .
it &apos;s the destruction of innocent lives !
you think you scare me more than the people i work for ?
no .
they can deal with you .
let me guess .
some bad guy missing his fancy new laptop .
harold backman . he &apos;s who starling city &apos;s worst call when they want to launder money in the caymans .
shouldn &apos;t we just turn this over to ,
i don &apos;t know , the irs ?
just as soon as you return the money to the rightful owners .
well , it sounds like a very nice idea .
backman &apos;s files are all protected with an asymmetric encryption algorithm .
really ? so it &apos;s gonna take a while to break in .
days , at least .
better get started , then .
at the risk of ending up with an arrow in my eye , can i ask ...
when are you planning on making peace with diggle ?
he &apos;s the one who left , felicity .
i did everything i could to stop him .
except apologize .
you promised you &apos;d help him track down floyd lawton and then you--
made a choice that i can life with .
if he can &apos;t , then i don &apos;t need him .
i need to get back to the club .
oliver--
let me know when you break in .
i wish someone would send me off to the caymans .
yes , i know it &apos;s been 6 months . but--
i am very well aware of the statistics .
but i haven &apos;t given up hope and neither should you .
that didn &apos;t sound too good .
_removed_
who were you talking to ?
just the insurance company .
they insist on paying out walter &apos;s life insurance policy .
i know we haven &apos;t talked about walter in a while , but i--i miss him , too .
it &apos;s like losing dad all over again .
you look radiant .
flatterer .
i think you &apos;re the last to arrive .
how &apos;s tommy ?
tommy is tommy . how &apos;s oliver ?
still in bed . it &apos;s only noon .
well , look who i just found .
get lost trying to find the house ?
you say that as if your driveway &apos;s not longer than most roads .
can i get anyone anything else ? frank ?
we &apos;re fine , dear , thank you .
_removed_
hello , mrs. queen . i &apos;m sorry to bother you at home .
oh , no , no . don &apos;t be silly , walter . come in , please .
you &apos;re here to see robert .
there &apos;s just some papers he needs to sign for the stock offering .
well , he &apos;s in some private meeting right now , but you &apos;re welcome to wait for him in his study .
thank you .
unless you &apos;d like to help me get my children out of the house .
you don &apos;t have children , do you , walter ?
not yet , i &apos;m afraid .
well , save yourself the trouble and don &apos;t .
they eventually all turn into teenagers .
adam hunt was reluctant at first , but was more cooperative upon being informed we knew about his embezzlement .
police communication system could use an upgrade .
i think mr. hunt can be persuaded to make an anonymous donation .
well , that will certainly cure what ails this city .
what &apos;s that , malcolm ?
we &apos;re emptying the atlantic with a tablespoon .
for years we &apos;ve been forcing the city &apos;s worst to do what is best , leverage them to help us save the city .
but it &apos;s ... not working .
crime in the glades is rising .
the cancer is spreading .
we just need to ... take some more time .
did the man who raped frank &apos;s daughter give her any quarter ?
everyone in this room has lost something or someone to the glades .
and we have committed ourselves to fixing it .
but what have we truly accomplished ?
nothing .
maybe it &apos;s because the glades can &apos;t be fixed .
you &apos;re saying we should abandon the project ?
yes .
in favor of a new undertaking .
like ben tre in vietnam .
the village must be destroyed before it can be saved .
are you suggesting we somehow ... level the glades ?
down to the bedrock .
only then can we truly rebuild starling city and make it safer for everyone .
that &apos;s 24 square blocks .
and if we did-- and i &apos;m not saying we should-- if we did , wouldn &apos;t suspicion fall on us ?
not if the destruction appears to be caused by a natural disaster .
you &apos;ve always had something of a god complex , malcolm .
it &apos;s part of your charm .
but even you can &apos;t create a natural disaster .
have you ever heard of unidac industries ?
it &apos;s a small company .
they have an idea ...
an idea that will serve our purposes .
my sources tell me they &apos;re 5 years away from prototype .
and any undertaking of value is worthy of patience .
and restraint .
one man alone can &apos;t save this city , robert , and we both know that .
of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world , she walks into mine .
this coffee &apos;s terrible , oliver .
that &apos;s what you get for ordering coffee in a bar .
you look tired .
too much work ?
too much crying .
tommy broke up with me .
what happened ?
i have no idea .
things were good . they were ...
great , and then suddenly he &apos;s packing up his things and telling me that it &apos;s over .
did he say anything to you ?
no . tommy and i haven &apos;t talked very much since he quit .
but he &apos;ll come around .
it &apos;s probably just cold feet .
like it was with you .
oliver , you don &apos;t sleep with your girlfriend &apos;s sister unless you &apos;re looking to blow the relationship up .
if you still want to be with tommy , do what we should have done .
talk to each other and be honest .
oliver , i need to show you what--
i just totally walked in on a thing , didn &apos;t i ?
i &apos;m sorry , uh , who are you ?
nobody . i mean , i &apos;m not nobody .
i &apos;m someone , obviously .
and so are you . you &apos;re laurel , right ?
that laurel . gorgeous laurel .
this is felicity . she &apos;s setting up my internet .
router . and i need to show oliver something very important related to it .
i &apos;ll let you go , then .
thank you for the coffee ... and the advice .
tell me you got in .
better . i hacked cayman fidelity and put together a list all the deposits backman made last year .
felicity , what good does that do us if we don &apos;t know whose money it was ?
look at the biggest deposit backman made last year .
bottom page .
$ 2 million on decem--
december 12 .
that &apos;s ...
the day walter disappeared .
what if one of backman &apos;s clients was paid 2 million to kidnap walter ?
then we find out which client it was ...
and we use them to find walter .
= = sync , corrected by elderman = =
ok , back-trace the account , follow the money , hopefully it will lead us to whoever kidnapped walter .
after all this time , do you think walter might still really be alive ?
i don &apos;t know .
got it .
dominic alonzo . yeah .
name ring a bell ?
alonzo runs the biggest underground casino in starling city when he &apos;s not busy kidnapping .
he looks like the kind of lowlife someone would hire to kidnap walter .
how many arrows do you think you &apos;ll have to put in him before he gives up walter &apos;s location ?
say a lot ?
it &apos;s not that simple .
that casino has its own private army .
we need to access alonzo &apos;s computer , but without setting off any alarms .
looks like we &apos;re gonna need all the help we can get .
it &apos;s too bad there &apos;s not someone else we could call .
that &apos;s enough . we can do this on our own .
well , then ... looks like someone &apos;s going gambling tonight .
those guys would make me the minute that i walked in there .
oliver queen would never be caught dead in a place like that .
i wasn &apos;t talking about you .
absolutely not .
i can count cards .
it &apos;s all probability theory and mathematics .
have you met me ?
bottom line--i know my way around a casino .
felicity , i &apos;m not letting you walk--
the reason i joined you in the first place was to find walter , and for the first time , we have a real chance of finding him .
you have to let me do this .
all right .
but we do it my way .
come on .
i &apos;m sorry i had to pull you away from whoever you were meeting .
oh , it &apos;s nothing . everyone &apos;s left already .
besides , it &apos;s my fault for forgetting to sign the k-5s this morning .
i hope you don &apos;t mind me asking , but is everything all right ?
just , uh , taking care of some odds and ends .
well , if ever you need a friendly ear .
you &apos;re a good man , walter .
i thought you &apos;d left .
i &apos;m still waiting for your answer .
how can you even think of doing this ?
that place took your soul , robert .
doing this won &apos;t give it back .
it won &apos;t bring back rebecca , either .
it still feels like yesterday , that day .
when she called my cell phone for the first time ,
i remember being annoyed .
she knew i was busy , so i just let it ring .
when she called back a minute later ,
i shut my phone off .
a little after midnight , two scpd officers showed up in my office .
all i remember them saying was ...
she &apos;d been shot .
murdered in the glades .
after the cops left , i sat in my office the rest of the night listening to rebecca &apos;s messages .
she kept calling my name ...
asking for help ... until she was just struggling to breathe , gasping for air .
i listened to my wife die over and over and over again .
i can &apos;t imagine , malcolm .
try .
imagine it was moira lying on that pavement , bleeding , calling your name .
and then tell me you wouldn &apos;t be prepared to do what i am .
what do you want ?
is that any way to treat a girl who just walked up 6 flights of stairs ?
no , it &apos;s not . where are my manners ? come on in .
thank you .
welcome .
did you do these ?
you know , felicity ,
oliver and i don &apos;t need a relationship counselor .
that hasn &apos;t been my experience .
we have a lead on walter .
i need you to come back and help us find him .
oliver put you up to this ?
no .
he doesn &apos;t even know i &apos;m here .
look .
i know oliver didn &apos;t help you find your brother &apos;s killer and that hurts .
it sucks . but ...
you gotta know if it was your life on the line on not just your ...
very understandable vendetta , he would be there for you .
no hesitation .
and i don &apos;t want a partnership with those kind of qualifications , felicity .
i know oliver &apos;s religiously against admitting he &apos;s wrong .
truth is , he needs you .
yeah .
and when oliver is ready to say that , he knows where i live .
sorry for bothering you .
it &apos;s no bother . i hope you find him .
wow , you really look like your father .
i never thought so before , but just now i saw him in you .
what are you doing here ?
we need to talk .
i said everything i have to say .
well , i haven &apos;t .
tommy , i love you , and i think that you still love me , so whatever problems that you think that we have ,
i know that if we face them together--
you don &apos;t understand .
then help me understand .
if our relationship is gonna end , at least let it end with honesty .
ok , laurel .
honestly ...
you belong with oliver .
excuse me ?
he &apos;s still in love with you .
i have a meeting .
you ready ?
i think so .
just to be clear , the plan is for me to get caught counting cards in an underground casino filled with hardened criminals .
so you can get a friendly warning from alonzo and plant a bug on his office computer .
right . which will hopefully lead us to walter .
that is assuming i get the friendly warning and not a bullet .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
yes , i do .
ok . if anything happens , i &apos;m right outside .
ok .

what do you see ?
6 armed guards , 2 pit bosses , and a floor man .
how do you call yourself a casino without any lucky 7s ?
stay focused , please .
i &apos;ll be with you the entire time .
thanks .
it feels really good having you inside me .
and by &quot; you , &quot; i mean your voice .
and by &quot; me , &quot; i mean my ear .
i &apos;m gonna stop talking right now .
that would be my preference .
one stack of high society , please .
thank you for stopping by .
of course .
uh , you said you had news .
it &apos;s ready .
the markov device passed its final beta test this morning .
applied sciences is loading it on a truck bound for starling city as we speak .
well ...
congratulations are in order , then .
to both of us .
moira , you may be surprised to know that i sometimes waver in my convictions .
but your friendship , your endless support ... always gives me the strength to carry on .
after all , you and i will always have a connection .
i &apos;m just sorry that robert &apos;s not here to celebrate with us .
i &apos;m sorry i had to take him from you .
if anyone &apos;s to blame for his death , it &apos;s me .
to robert .
to rebecca .
are you feeling all right ?
i know tonight was just another ted kord fund-raiser , but you were surprisingly quiet .
moira , there &apos;s something i need to talk to you about .
robert , if this is what i think it is ,
i don &apos;t want to know her name . i don &apos;t--
no , it &apos;s about malcolm .
he wants to level the glades .
and how does malcolm propose to evacuate an entire section of the city ?
he doesn &apos;t .
robert , that doesn &apos;t sound like you .
because i &apos;m not the man you think i am .
about a month before the opening of steele factory , the one in the glades ,
i was approached by a local councilman .
he wanted money .
told me that &apos;s the way everything was done in the glades .
i told him i &apos;d never paid a bribe in my life .
we got into an argument .
i didn &apos;t want to hurt him .
i swear , moira .
but he fell .
oh , dear god .
oh , dear god .
the work i &apos;m doing with malcolm , with the list , it &apos;s my penance , moira .
what , so you &apos;ll atone for one murder by committing hundreds , thousands ?
robert .
you listen to me .
whatever wrongs you &apos;ve committed , whatever mistakes you &apos;ve made , preventing this horror is your chance to make it right .
please ...
please , robert , promise me you won &apos;t let this happen .
oh ! blackjack !
miss ...
can you come with me ?
is something wrong ?
get up .
oh , since you ask so nicely .
oh , there &apos;s the bathroom .
i should have known the manager &apos;s office would be down the hall and to the right of the bathroom .
mr. alonzo .
have a seat .
what &apos;s your name ?
megan .
do you know where the term &quot; 86 &quot; comes from , megan ?
as it happens , i do . it &apos;s from prohibition .
there was a-- an illegal casino , not like this one , located at 86 bedford street in new york , and ...
god , you know , i &apos;m just gonna stop talking .
now it means to ban someone , someone who &apos;s cheating .
leave your chips and go .
thank you .
oh , yeah , megan , one more thing .
you see , the thing about card counters is , uh ... sometimes they work ... with a partner .
you &apos;re gonna be really upset when you meet my partner .
i heard you never miss .
i don &apos;t .
where &apos;s walter steele ?
what ? what a you talking about , huh ?
6 months ago you had him kidnapped !
it was just a job . i was given a name .
i didn &apos;t ask any questions .
last chance .
where is he ?
below ground .
you &apos;re lying !
i delivered him and they killed him .
i heard the gunshot .
he &apos;s dead .
oh , let &apos;s see that blouse in that violet shade .
you &apos;re a miracle worker , thea .
oh , when it comes to shopping , it &apos;s not work , really .
hey . i &apos;m teaching mom the joys of online clothes shopping .
ollie ?
are you ok ?
i need to talk to you both .
what is it ?
it &apos;s about walter .
did the police contact you ?
one of mr. diggle &apos;s army buddies works for the fbi now .
and they got news tonight .
no .
i &apos;m very sorry .
no , no , no , no , no .
there must be some mistake .
who did mr. diggle talk to ? did they find a body ?
mom ...
walter &apos;s gone . no . this isn &apos;t right .
where are you going ?
_removed_
i need some air . it &apos;s 10 : 00 at night .
mom , you &apos;re in shock .
don &apos;t tell me what or how i feel , oliver .
why is she acting like that ?
come here .
i suspect i know what this is about .
you and i got in bed with malcolm to cure what ails this city .
but i think you agree , killing thousands of people is not the answer .
indeed .
if we were to wage a war with malcolm merlyn , we will lose .
my family has already suffered enough .
and i have no desire to endanger mine .
fortunately , there &apos;s another option .
6 months ago , malcolm started buying up buildings in the glades through an offshore company called sagittarius .
and he made it sound as if this undertaking of his was a recent inspiration .
if you &apos;re right , he has been thinking about this for months .
if he can &apos;t rebuild it , he &apos;ll abandon the project .
how much of the glades does he already have ?
about a third .
now , if we can quietly buy up the rest before he can , he won &apos;t be able to gain the control he needs .
we will need capital .
do you still have your contacts in china ?
i already have a flight planned for shanghai tomorrow .
come with me .
we shouldn &apos;t travel together . malcolm might get worried .
he already knows i have my doubts .
besides , i &apos;m getting the urge to take out the &quot; queen &apos;s gambit &quot;
for another voyage .
dad ! do you have any cash ?
jerk pizza guy can &apos;t break a 100 .
hey . hi . waiting .
♪ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , tell me ...
pizza .
my hero .
i &apos;m starved .
yeah .
hey , ollie .
where do you keep the bottle opener in this thing ?
bottom drawer .
did you talk to ray today ?
about the ski trip ?
no . he asked jean to move in with him last night .
oh . guess they &apos;ve been together forever .
we &apos;ve been together longer .
guess we have .
i only bring this up because your mom busted me yesterday .
and obviously we can &apos;t hang out at my house .
because your father threatened to tase me the last time that i closed the door to your bedroom ?
so wouldn &apos;t it be nice to have a little place of our own ?
yeah .
maybe . this is a little fast , laurel .
i know that you like to think of yourself as a bad boy , oliver queen , but ...
i feel like we &apos;re ready to take the next step .
yeah .
let &apos;s do it .
you lied to me .
we had a deal .
gong dag .
what are you talking about ?
you promised if i cooperated with the undertaking , walter wouldn &apos;t be harmed !
_removed_
and i know ...
i know you &apos;ve had him killed .
turn on the camera .
oh , walter ...
like you said , moira , we have an agreement .
walter would stay in my custody until the undertaking was complete .
we &apos;re both in this together .
i &apos;ve been sitting in the dark all day , too .
all these months i kept thinking if i could find a clue , i could get a lead on him .
guess it wouldn &apos;t have mattered .
i can &apos;t imagine what your family &apos;s going through .
walter &apos;s alive .
what ?
but alonzo said--
i need you to pull up malcolm merlyn &apos;s phone records .
he made a call from his office to wherever walter is being kept at 10 : 30 p.m .
malcolm merlyn ?
tommy &apos;s father ?
why would he kidnap walter ?
l.u.d. showed he made a call to a tenement complex located in bludhaven .
can you pull up a satellite view ?
ok .
that &apos;s a lot of security for low-income housing .
there &apos;s two guards stationed at all access points .
there &apos;s just one on the roof . exactly . there &apos;s no other buildings in that area .
if you want to get onto the roof , you &apos;re going to have to jump off of something .
there &apos;s a problem in quadrant 4 .
mr. steele .
walter .
what ?
what &apos;s happening ?
you &apos;re going home .
i thought i &apos;d never see you again .
i &apos;m all right .
welcome home , walter .
thank you , son .
thea .
this is totally a family thing , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m sorry , who are you ?
this is felicity .
she &apos;s my friend .
mine , too .
it &apos;s good to see you .
you , too .
i &apos;ll let you guys get back to your hugging .
oliver .
we &apos;re all together again .
everything &apos;s gonna be all right .
robert , i don &apos;t like the idea of this .
it &apos;s gonna be ok .
yeah , well , how long will you be gone ?
a few weeks . maybe more , depending on what i--
why can &apos;t you just fly to china ?
i think it &apos;s better the less you know .
i just hate that stupid boat .
look at me .
i love you .
everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
ok .
got room for one more ?
no .
mom , let me keep dad company .
oliver , you &apos;re in school .
not really .
i tried to tell you that .
i could use an extra hand on the ship .
robert ...
moira , let the kid take the boat out with the old man .
all right .
all right .
but you promise me that you &apos;ll behave yourself .
all right . i promise .
i love you so much .
i love you , too .
i totally spaced .
i gotta call tommy and let him know
i &apos;m out of town for a few weeks .
i &apos;ll see you on board in 5 .
sara ? you here ?
yeah , you might want to circle around the block a few times , because your sister just showed up .
hi . what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re leaving for 3 weeks .
i wanted to come say bye to you in person .
i &apos;m glad you did .
and ...
i wanted to bring you something .
in case you get lonely at sea .
thank you .
hey , is everything ok ?
i mean , i didn &apos;t totally freak you out when i brought up the whole apartment thing earlier , did i ?
no .
good .
no .
but i do have to get back to the boat .
yeah .
is it done ? yes .
the bomb is in place .
and there &apos;s a storm front moving in along the &quot; gambit &apos;s &quot; projected course .
ok .
when the &quot; queen &apos;s gambit &quot; goes down , no one will suspect it &apos;s anything other than an act of god .
oliver .
ah . what a miracle .
how &apos;s walter ?
the police are saying that he was rescued by the vigilante .
yes , he was .
has he said anything about his ordeal ?
was he able to identify any of his captors ?
no .
that &apos;s too bad .
they &apos;ll get what &apos;s coming to them .
i &apos;m just glad that my family is back together .
we all are .
ollie .
excuse me .
is walter ok ?
i saw it on the news .
yeah .
are you ok ?
of course .
i promise you now is not the time .
it &apos;s you and tommy .
you and me , actually .
i talked to tommy yesterday , and the reason he broke up with me is because he thinks that you and i still belong together .
what did you say ?
nothing .
he walked out on me .
i just want you to be happy .
it &apos;s what i &apos;ve always wanted .
then will you please go talk to tommy for me ?
and say what ?
say that you and i are over .
that you &apos;re not still in love with me .
i can &apos;t do that .
why not ?
because it wouldn &apos;t be true .
and i have enough lies in my life already .
i guess you do know where i live .
i &apos;ve always known where you live .
may i ?
i &apos;m sorry .
you were right .
and i was wrong .
about deadshot ?
about everything .
about my mother and about her involvement in the undertaking .
she lied to me .
to thea .
she &apos;s working with malcolm merlyn .
they &apos;re planning something .
something ...
terrible .
i don &apos;t know what yet .
but i just know one thing .
i need your help to stop them .

this film is based on a true story .
director han , three minutes to standby .
so , what &apos;s your closing for today ?
hey , now .
i hear people are really looking forward to it .
everyone &apos;s talking about it , you know , about your closing statements being so refreshing .
you know the viewers always come first .
that &apos;s the last ad , now . ten seconds left .
alright , five seconds . standby .
super , start .
second camera on standby and cut !
good evening , everyone .
we didn &apos;t have many days of laughter this year .
standing at the finish line of the nineties , we all had high hopes for this year .
we struggled hard against the tide of change around the world , and within our country ,
- it was a year that demanded
_removed_
we wake up and realize our faults as we face
_removed_
the beginning of the twenty-first century .
- now , dbc news will begin .
_removed_
eighteen . just a little more .
we declare war against crime and violence ...
yes , it &apos;s been a long time since our president seemed so trustwon &apos;thy .
however , despite his ambitions and declarations , this was a banner year for crime .
briefly said , it was a crisis for public welfare .
in the year ahead ,
i hope the average joe will be able to keep the smile on his face .
trust you , sir ?
believe me , we &apos;d like to .
voice of a murderer
- hey , look sharp up there .
- min-sun ...
- min-sun !
- we haven &apos;t taken a picture yet !
in this case , the suspect was someone that knew the family , and when he didn &apos;t get the ransom ,
yoo min-sun he choked the child to death and buried her body .
so this case shows how kidnappers that destroy families are always nail , always brought to justice .
yes , now we can &apos;t even send our kids to school with peace of mind .
mr. president wants our trust , but the world is in chaos .
the police are working very hard , but it seems they need to work harder .
what good is it to catch the criminal , when min-sun was taken away screaming and returned cold and lifeless ?
crime is beyond the reach of the law .
must forensic science also be out of our reach ?
madam , would you please open the door ?
late again , like any other day .
look at what time it is .
ah , home sweet home .
you reek of alcohol .
oh , you don &apos;t like it ?

good boy . plant one right here .
my heir , you believe in your old man , right ?
i &apos;ll take care of it , so eat all you want .

yeah , okay .

see , this is the fucking problem .
what &apos;s the best shot we &apos;ve got ? huh ?
wouldrt that be arresting him , sir ?
forensic science makes that the voice , sir .
yeah , that motherfucker &apos;s voice .
yeah , that damned voice !
there have been 11 phone calls so far and seeing how he never goes over two minutes , the suspect appears to be extremely intelligent and cunning .
we &apos;ve currently identified and are investigating six suspects .
are you saying that out of eleven calls , we couldn &apos;t get a single trace ?
once , we kept him on for a while and traced him to the samsung trade center .
but that was before the kidnapping was reported ...
right now , we have two of our men stationed down there undercover .
you think he &apos;s an idiot ?
he won &apos;t call from there again knowing it &apos;ll be traced .
detective .
i mean , i &apos;m just saying . let &apos;s be more scientific about it .
anyway , make sure this doesn &apos;t get out .
we have to bring the kid back alive .
remember who the father is , alright ?

please have some faith in us , mr. han .
responsibility my ass .
look here , mr. han .
you &apos;re the father , so it &apos;s crucial he comes back alive , but we &apos;re cops .
- what did you just say ?
- no , what i mean is ... we need to catch the culprit to get sang-woo back alive ...
so what we need to do now is to have hope and work together . have faith , eh ?
that &apos;s right .
the kidnapper won &apos;t be caught easily .
no matter what , you must trust the police !
now , you &apos;ve already made contact with him on your own , which was very risky .
luckily , your wife contacted us now , so please have faith and leave it to us .
actually , i don &apos;t know if i should say this ... but , my girls were begging me to get them your autograph , if possible ...

what ?
you think you can get away with this ?
you &apos;ve got some nerve , i &apos;ll give you that .
who &apos;s threatening whom now , huh ?
excuse me ?
get a grip , mr. han .
look , whoever you are , i &apos;ll let it go .
i &apos;ll give you all the money too . hello ?

you mean the friend made the phone threats ?
does that make sense ?
he knows his voice .
it ... doesn &apos;t , of course ...
but , would the voice really matter that much ?
what matters is this strong motive ...
well , our scientific analysis shows that the voiceprint doesn &apos;t match up 100 % .
come on . he could &apos;ve gotten someone else to call .
lee jae-jun could have a partner .
we &apos;re still investigating that .
forensics is all fine and dandy , but still ...
you have to follow your instincts , right ?
is that how a cop got kidnapped ?

the thing that &apos;s eating me up inside ...
i called myself a dad and i did nothing . i couldn &apos;t even play with him .
i thought all i had to do was to bring him into the world .
i can &apos;t remember a thing . not one thing .
my boy ...
he must have needed me so much ...
i &apos;m gonna quit . i mean , i didn &apos;t even catch him .

good evening , everyone . it feels good to be back .
dbc news at nine o &apos;clock on thursday , august 8th , will begin .
first up tonight .
the body of a nine-year-old boy was found at the bank of the han river , 44 days after he was abducted from a local playground .
park jin-oh reports .
i &apos;m here in banpo , where the dead body of nine-year-old
han sang-woo was found .
he was found with his arms and legs bound with a clothesline , his mouth taped shut , and his body was frozen .
the presumption is that he was suffocated , possibly one day after he was kidnapped .
to the family that waited for 44 days of pain , news of the child &apos;s death was an unanticipated blow to the heart .
the school han sang-woo had studied and played at is also in deep shock .
i hope they catch the man that killed sang-woo .
sang-woo .
although the police conducted a secret investigation , they still have no clues as to the identity of the criminal .
the police must determine what , and who , caused a young , hopeful boy to return home in a body bag after these 44 days of terror .
- director han , we &apos;ve got 3 seconds .
- this is park jin-oh , dbc news .
yes , the truly unspeakable ... has happened once again .
the killer made over eighty-seven threatening phone calls to the victim &apos;s family and extorted them for two hundred thousand dollars .
despite these efforts , in the end ...

sang-woo didn &apos;t make it home ...
don &apos;t cry .
and his lifeless body was discovered ... near the han river park .

i &apos;m sorry .
all the viewers out there , please help me just this once .

the recording i &apos;m going to play , listen carefully to this voice .
sang-woo is gone , but the monster that took his life ... is shamelessly breathing , living beside you .
you listen to me very carefully .
there is no such thing as a perfect crime .
i will hunt you down ... to the ends of this earth ... and i will catch you .
sang-woo ...
sang-woo ...
ladies and gentleman , please . please , please listen closely ...
the voice that you are listening to is the voice of
hello ?
the actual killer , recorded in 1991 . please listen very carefully .
i gave him pills because he was coming down with a cold , and he &apos;s sleeping now .
anyway ...
please open the back seat once and leave the inside lights on .
the back seats .
leave the door open , and leave the trunk open .
then , you can go into the bakery and wait there .
you need to leave the keys inside .
the killer is believed to be a male , open the trunk .
with an average build , approximately 5 &apos; 6 &quot; to 5 &apos; 7 &quot; tall open it up all the way .
and then close it and speaks with a seoul and gyeonggi province dialect . then come straight to the domestic terminal at the airport .
he was believed to be in his early to mid-thirties you have very little devotion to your child .
at the time of the crime ( 1991 ) . someone was sitting in the back seat .
i &apos;m telling you , there was someone in the back seat .
ma &apos;am , then you will have to come yourself .
to be honest , i just don &apos;t trust your husband .

previously on nikita .
operation pale fire .
division collaborated with sergei semak to kill nikolai udinov and his family .
i saved the daughter , alexandra .
your partner ?
that &apos;s why she &apos;s working with you to take down the division .
- her focus has shifted . - revenge .
that &apos;s where i &apos;m going ... to get the man who ordered my parents to die .
and i &apos;m going to kill him .
mom ?
the guardians ... they &apos;re gathering , and percy is behind it .
we don &apos;t know if anything is happening with percy , but what we do know is that ari has the box .
i &apos;ll go after the guardian . you go after ari .
and you &apos;ll be fine with him . no .
michael goes with you .
you &apos;re chasing ari tasarov into the heart of gogol territory .
you don &apos;t even know where he &apos;s headed .
yeah , she does .
i put a tracker on his car . i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m going to find there , but it &apos;s the right thing to do .
hello , ari .
operation pale fire ...
background is need-to-know .
this is the target zone .
papa bear , mama bear , and baby bear .
our man on the inside has provided extensive intel to the layout of the home and all the security measures that are in place .
papa bear likes to maintain a semblance of normalcy for his family , so the estate grounds will be far more heavily guarded than inside the house itself .
patrols will be shifted to the north , so you will come up through the woods from the south , up the drive , and into the front door .
current alarm codes will be in your briefing packet .
review the material , be ready in two hours .
dismissed .
roan , stay back a minute .
is there a problem ?
how ?
how ?
mama ...
i thought you were dead .
they said , &quot; mother down . &quot;
nikolai ... he heard men downstairs ...
shooting . he left me .
i can &apos;t remember .
i saw a gun .
i woke up in hospital .
you were dead .
everyone was dead .
someone took me .
she saved my life .
bingo . - what &apos;s that ? - update from nikita .
looks like the tracker you put on ari tasarov &apos;s car worked .
i know you guys want to replace the box you lost , but ... maybe she should just let it go .
we can &apos;t let ari keep that box .
if he finds a way to decrypt it , i don &apos;t want to think about what he &apos;d do with those dirty secrets .
you should be with her .
i could &apos;ve tracked this guardian on my own .
he &apos;s going to meet up with the other guardians .
you want to take on all three by yourself ?
no . nikita was right .
we got to grab that box and then figure out what the guardians are up to ...
what percy &apos;s up to .
what &apos;d you find ?
i narrowed it down to these six hotels .
those are some nice places .
i thought the guardians were more &quot; bed of nails &quot; and all .
easier to get lost in a crowd at a big hotel .
these are the right size , near public transportation , with multiple points of egress .
okay , so we zero him down , track him to the gathering , and figure out how percy &apos;s pulling the strings .
- why are you still in london ?
- excuse me ?
nikita says you &apos;re staying in london to be with the kid .
is that gonna be a permanent thing or ... ? whoa .
why is she even talking to you about this ?
she needs to talk to somebody .
it &apos;s getting harder for her .
maybe she can &apos;t talk to you &apos; cause she thinks she already lost you .
- she hasn &apos;t .
- i know .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m warning you .
you need to make a choice before someone makes it for you .
and who &apos;s gonna make that for me ...
you ?
i don &apos;t have a kid .
you killed her fiance .
yeah . nikita said he was a nice , normal guy ...
didn &apos;t deserve to die ...
neither did emily .
she was innocent , just like your son .
she died because of me , because that &apos;s what happens when normal people get sucked into our world .
they get hurt .
mama , have you been here all these years ...
in this house ?
i have to hide .
no one can know that i &apos;m in here .
are you all right ?
i heard voices downstairs . what &apos;s happening ?
i &apos;m attending to some business .
why are you so nervous ?
whenever i hear too many voices downstairs , - it makes me think of the men who ...
- who cannot hurt you now .
the house is protected . no one knows you &apos;re here .
i don &apos;t need that .
let &apos;s not go through this again , katya .
you need some rest .
take the pill .
i should &apos;ve killed semak when i had the chance .
_removed_
- it &apos;s okay , mama .
i understand now .
semak was always jealous of papa .
he always wanted everything papa had , so he took it .
he can have zetrov , but he can &apos;t have you ...
not anymore .
i just don &apos;t understand .
i have to leave for a few minutes , but i &apos;ll be right back .
just stay here .
crap .
hello , ryan .
how are you feeling today ? more cooperative ?
if this is about oversight ...
i need to neutralize them now , in a way that doesn &apos;t raise questions or leave evidence to trace back to me .
i &apos;ve given you their identities . you &apos;ve had a while to think .
i kept you alive because i thought you might be useful , but if i was wrong ...
then i should correct my mistake .
i told you ...
the only way i can help is if i know everything on division , oversight ...
even the details you don &apos;t think are relevant .
you know ...
today is your lucky day .
i &apos;m gonna have to take you to the files .
they don &apos;t transport well .
so , now you want to take down oversight .
and your big hope is the little librarian .
that &apos;s just sad .
i need some leverage to keep the lights on around here .
bringing down oversight is something we all want ...
you , me ...
even the librarian here .
remind me ... what &apos;s in it for me ?
fine .
i &apos;ll give you your things back , if you give him something useful .
how about i give him the mercy of a quick death ?
well , that wouldn &apos;t be very polite , would it ?
yeah ? what are you gonna do about it ...
kill me ?
three words , percy ... medically induced coma .
consider the consequences .
play nice .
what a bitch , right ?
why are you here ?
ari tasarov has a black box .
i &apos;m here to steal it back .
so your plan is to cut the power , let everyone freak and grab the box in the chaos ?
that was the ...
yeah .
- careful .
- can &apos;t let you do that ...
not without screwing up my plan to rescue my mother .
she &apos;s alive , nikita . she &apos;s upstairs .
- your mother ? how ? - i don &apos;t know .
but if i &apos;m gonna get her out , no one can know we &apos;re here .
where are we with the box ?
well , we think we found a way around the biometrics lock , but the data encryption may take weeks to break .
i &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
percy is nothing if not paranoid .
it &apos;s one of his few admirable qualities .
keep on it .
mr. abramov , did you receive the photograph i sent you ?
it &apos;s her ... the girl who bought my weapons .
she &apos;s here in russia .
tell no one else . i &apos;ll take care of it .
yes , mr. tasarov ?
increase patrols on the estate immediately , then come up to the house .
i &apos;d like to discuss the perimeter breach we spoke of earlier .
i have to disable the alarm .
let me sneak her out , then i &apos;ll go .
_removed_
look , you can blow up this damn house , for all i care , after i know she &apos;s safe .
what are you doing ?
when he misses the next check-in , they &apos;re gonna know something &apos;s wrong .
i got a plan .
the black box can wait .
we &apos;re gonna get your mother out ...
tonight .
nothing on the hotel guest list matches our guardian .
well , that &apos;s our fourth strike .
that &apos;s a guardian .
not that i should say this , but ...
i kind of wish you were still on the regimen .
so do i .
is that a bad thing ?
he &apos;s picking up his shirts ?
he &apos;s at a four-star hotel .
why would he send his shirts out for cleaning ?
percy loved all that cold war spy crap ...
dead drops and code words and ...
in two hours , he &apos;s gonna be at the dry cleaner &apos;s .
maybe then we &apos;ll find out where the meeting is .
once we do , i &apos;m pretty sure we got a way inside .
so i &apos;ll go in the way i did before ...
through the cellar and up the laundry chute , which puts me here ...
right outside the bedroom door .
i &apos;ll take my mother down the back stairs , and if you wait at this door , we can take the guards out then .
it should buy us enough time before they realize there &apos;s a breach .
you &apos;re missing something .
how do we get off the estate ?
we both got here on foot through the woods .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s an option for your mother .
we have to steal a car .
but that could draw too much attention .
depends on the car .
- ari &apos;s here , right ?
- yeah .
he &apos;s got his own car and driver .
only an insane gogol agent would try and stop ari tasarov &apos;s car .
how do we know which car is his ?
ari &apos;s driver never leaves the car , for security reasons .
i &apos;ll deal with him , get behind the wheel ...
- if they follow us ...
- they won &apos;t .
i &apos;m going to disable all the other cars .
it &apos;s a little trick michael taught me .
if you can delay your enemy for even a few minutes ...
it might be enough to win the day . you taught me that .
thank you ...
for helping us .
don &apos;t thank me yet .
has anyone missed their scheduled check-ins ?
no , sir . they &apos;ve all reported in .
_removed_
i want you to go out personally and check with your own eyes that everyone is at their posts .
yes , sir .
i have new information with regards to ms. udinov .
i believe she &apos;s here ...
somewhere on the property .
amanda thinks that you &apos;re going to be able to come up with the scheme to dismantle oversight , huh ?
- that offends you ?
- it does , yeah .
i mean , i had them under control .
and then they got to amanda ...
and she got intimidated .
now she &apos;s running into the ground everything you took years to build ...
well ...
you and oversight .

i &apos;ve heard that percy is being held prisoner inside division .
have you seen him ?
yes , let &apos;s talk about percy .
i &apos;m curious why he saved you .
and what was he planning to do with you ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you were supposed to die , yet here you are .
why would division spare your life ?
percy never struck me as a soft touch .
oh , my god .
that story yuri told about me being brainwashed ...
that wasn &apos;t just some cover story .
you actually thought it was true .
i thought it was quite a brilliant plan .
i &apos;m sorry to disappoint .
division didn &apos;t rescue me that night ... nikita did .
_removed_
that is the ...
rogue agent , yes . she is a soft touch .
i infiltrated division .
i wanted to make percy pay .
mission accomplished . he &apos;s in a hole .

what are you picking up ?
three shirts ... blue ...
lightly starched and pressed , boxed .
this isn &apos;t a clue to the meeting .
this is the meeting .
i say we bomb the place ...
no more guardians , no more black boxes .
this meeting is our only chance at figuring out what percy &apos;s up to .
last time he had a big secret plan , he tried to level the seventh floor of the cia .
so you &apos;re gonna walk in there , alone , and meet with two guardians ?
we barely managed to take down one of them together .
i &apos;m not going in alone .
we &apos;ll be on comms , and that box is my backup .
- be ready when i give the word .
- i got ya .
i seem to have misplaced my ticket .
what are you picking up ?
three shirts ... blue ...
lightly starched and pressed , boxed .
you &apos;re the other guardian ?
when did that happen ?
i thought you were percy &apos;s right-hand man .
that &apos;s why he chose me .
thanks to nikita , you guys were dropping like flies , and percy wanted extra insurance .
right before amanda took over , he gave me a box and told me to run .
i don &apos;t believe you .
then i &apos;ll prove it to you .
can &apos;t believe he didn &apos;t tell us .
well , things happened pretty fast that day .
are we missing a box ?
i see only two , but there are three of us .
did you lose something ?
how &apos;d you go from oversight &apos;s golden boy to its chief extortioner ?
downside of being invisible ?
lack of visibility .
running this place , you &apos;ve become a deniable asset ...
someone who could be wiped away if he stepped out of line .
you needed leverage .
that &apos;s what the black boxes are for .
but there had to be a catalyst ?
some incident that soured your relationship with oversight .
well , that reached critical mass with operation pale fire .
in 2005 , a russian conglomerate ... zetrov ...
refusing to do business with the united states .
it was a threat to national security ?
oversight saw it as a threat to financial security ...
theirs , in particular ...
so they came to me .
and i discovered that the ceo &apos;s number two ...
a man named sergei semak ... might be pliable .
you turned him ...
plotted with him to kill zetrov &apos;s founder ... nikolai udinov , alex &apos;s father .
i know the backstory .
it was semak &apos;s idea to kill the family .
he said that if he could have control , he would be our man on the inside ...
expand u.s. interests throughout his hemisphere .
that &apos;s a pretty big promise .
exactly what i said .
i said he couldn &apos;t be trusted , and i was right .
- he took over ...
- and reneged on the deal .
yeah . they want to blame me for it .
now , amanda and oversight think that alex is going to take over zetrov .
well , that ain &apos;t gonna happen .
she &apos;s going to kill semak and plunge the company into complete chaos .
amanda has lost control of her girl .
history does tend to repeat itself .
you say that that mission was when everything went sideways with oversight .
no . no , the real threat wasn &apos;t forming over your head .
it was happening right under your nose .
pale fire was the first time nikita ever disobeyed orders .
she rescued alex that night ...
her first strike against division ...
and the first step of your journey ... right into this cage .
you sent nikita on that mission ... and sealed your own fate .
how bad is it ?
looks worse than it is .
take this , okay ?
what are you doing ?
wait for my call .
i want you to tell katya who i am .
you &apos;re going back ?
i told you , we &apos;re getting your mom out tonight .
guardians ...
did everyone make it ?
three guardians ... present .
open your packets .
visually confirm each other &apos;s identity .
maintain security profile alpha .
we rendezvous in new york in two days .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m not a guardian .
i &apos;m just a guy who rigged a black box with explosives .
don &apos;t stop until we get to brussels , just to be safe .
i &apos;m not slowing down till this thing runs out of gas .
nikita hasn &apos;t called me back .
it &apos;s been a while .
who are you ?
i &apos;m a friend of your daughter &apos;s .
i &apos;m here to get you out .
okay ?
here ...
talk to her .
you will get her killed .
no , she &apos;s safe .
i saved her from ari &apos;s men .
i made her safe .
i told sergei she was here ... not ari .
my alexandra is sick , very sick .
- yes .
- mr. tasarov ...
we have two guards down at the back of the house .
secure mr. semak .
do not leave his side until i tell you otherwise .
have your men sweep the entire house .
someone else is here . find them .
the americans took her , and they filled her head with lies ...
lies about sergei .
now she wants to kill him ?
sergei wants your daughter dead .
no .
no , he wants to help her .
we want to put her someplace safe where the doctors can come and heal the damage done to her mind , make her see the truth .
you want to know the truth ?
he hired the americans to wipe out your family so he could take control of zetrov .
this is a lie .
i was there , katya .
i was on the strike team . we had everything .
we had alarm codes . we had floor plans .
we had security patrol schedules ... all given to us by semak .
_removed_
i killed your husband .
no , sergei loves me .
he wanted zetrov , and he wanted you .
he had me .
we had each other .
you were having an affair .
that &apos;s why you survived that night .
it was part of his deal with percy , wasn &apos;t it ?
right now you come with me .
i &apos;m not asking .
- let &apos;s go . - okay .
you feeling better ?
i don &apos;t feel anything now ...
if that &apos;s what you want to know .
you were screaming and tearing the room apart .
you could have hurt yourself . i had to do something .
i &apos;ve lost her again .
now she &apos;ll never come back to me .
let &apos;s hope not .
_removed_
you won &apos;t hurt her .
we had a deal .
she and her associate killed half of my men .
i cannot let that stand .
you promised not to hurt alexandra .
but she &apos;s not your alexandra anymore , katya .
you must see that now .
i see many things now .
living down here , i &apos;ve had time to reflect .
you know what i &apos;ve come to realize ?
you like your reflection .
i &apos;ve seen that i &apos;ve made mistakes .
but that i can also learn from them .
sometimes all you need is a slight shift in perspective to bring things into focus .
you have had time to reflect .
i &apos;ve also had time to plan .
against oversight ?
i told you , they &apos;re irrelevant .
as you said , there &apos;s always a group behind the group .
if you look close , you &apos;ll see there &apos;s a door up there .
where could you possibly go ?
to a higher place ...
not the place you &apos;re thinking of .
i think the phone &apos;s a dead end .
- well , we know they &apos;re headed home .
- and roan &apos;s running things .
he &apos;s how percy &apos;s communicating with them .
we were his insurance policy .
- what ?
- the guardians .
we were the thing that kept percy alive .
but percy planned for every contingency .
in the event of his death , we were to upload the boxes .
maybe in the event of his capture ...
you break him out .
i &apos;ll stay home until you get here , and we &apos;ll figure out the percy stuff then .
owen thinks we should let him escape and then shoot him .
that &apos;s not a bad idea ...
although we &apos;d probably fight over who got to shoot him first .
and we should talk ... about us and ... where we stand .
i &apos;ll be here .
you don &apos;t have to go on this one .
i can talk to percy and find another agent for pale fire ...
maybe kelly .
she &apos;d love that .
i &apos;d never hear the end of it .
_removed_
i know you hate these kinds of missions ...
with civilians .
it &apos;s important to percy , right ?
it &apos;ll be good for me to go .
you &apos;re a capable agent .
you don &apos;t have to prove that to him anymore .
you once told me that division was a second chance ...
an opportunity to be a new person , make a difference .
this mission ...
this is how i prove to myself what kind of person i &apos;ve become .
you know , for years , i &apos;ve had ... these memories to hold on to ...
an image in my head of what i &apos;d lost .
no matter how bad things got , i could close my eyes , and ...
they were there .
that &apos;s what got you through .
but it was a lie .
and now i can &apos;t even trust my own memories .
her and semak ...
i never had a clue .
you were a kid who loved her parents .
i &apos;ve wasted so much time and energy ...
avenging what ?
a father that loved me , but wasn &apos;t innocent and ... a mother that ...
- maybe never loved me at all . - alex ...
i don &apos;t understand katya &apos;s choices , but i do think that she loves you .
you can &apos;t know that .
she could &apos;ve been in on semak &apos;s plan all along .
no , i think that she &apos;s misguided and not facing reality .
but when she said that she wanted to keep you safe , i believed her .
she was afraid of losing you .
she was more afraid of losing him .
i don &apos;t know how to get past that .
you don &apos;t have to figure it all out right now .
don &apos;t give up on her ...
not yet .
i heard you ...
on the phone .
even after you knew what she did , you still tried to reach her .
people make mistakes .
you know , they make bad choices .
and then to make up for them , they make even worse ones .
but if you give them a second chance , sometimes they surprise you .
yeah .
sometimes they do .

what ?
nothing , it &apos;s just ... so sad .
claire .
we both knew exactly what she was .
yes , i know , she was the bitchy side character .
hm ?
sorry .
-go . -oh .
but , seth , suicide ?
a character like ga-in , she would have killed joon , not herself .
plus , the exact same way mr. park died , which was a murder .
this isn &apos;t real life , this is a k-drama , so whoever killed mr. park killed ga-in , right ?
this isn &apos;t one of those dramas , claire .
this isn &apos;t a mystery , it &apos;s romance .
it was supposed to be a romance .
you look really nice , by the way . all like pressed and clean .
very , like , manly .
that &apos;s nice of you to say .
you look very nice yourself .
well , it is a funeral .
we &apos;re sorry for your loss .
thank you for coming .
now , this isn &apos;t real life , this is a k-drama , so whoever did it to mr. park and ga-in , they &apos;d be here for the memorial .
extra , extra ...
seo-yeon , no .
mrs. park ... oh , maybe .
-claire .
-what ?
it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t appreciate all your sleuthing here , but i don &apos;t think this is the time and place .
i don &apos;t know what else to do !
- your boyfriend &apos;s not here .
- joon &apos;s not my boyfriend .
don &apos;t you think that that &apos;s odd he &apos;s not here ?
don &apos;t you think that that &apos;s , i don &apos;t know , a little suspicious ?
the fiancé of the deceased is the only recurring character that &apos;s missing ?
i don &apos;t know .
where the hell is he ?
keep this safe !
all of north korea &apos;s atomic missile secrets are inside . no , no !
_removed_
i have my own problems .
hey !
are you okay ?
she and i were never going to be best friends ,
but if i &apos;d known this was going to happen ...
i &apos;m so sorry ...
don &apos;t cry , seo-yeon .
i feel so sorry ...
you have no reason to feel that way .
if anyone has a reason to feel guilty , it &apos;s park joon for not being here .
seth !
not now .
dad , i &apos;m sorry i never got a chance to say goodbye .
you , too , ga-in . i would have liked to cook for you .
kimchi fried rice
dad , remember how you used to cook for me ?
let &apos;s at least share one last meal together .
- seth .
- hm ?
i keep asking myself over and over , who benefited from mr. park &apos;s death ?
who benefits from ga-in &apos;s death ?
and there &apos;s only one answer .
what if i was all wrong and joon &apos;s the murderer ?
joon ? the murderer ?
well , think about it .
his father wanted him to inherit the company . dead .
ga-in was trying to force him to marry her . dead .
- but he &apos;s the leading man .
- who else could it possibly be ?
seth !
i don &apos;t have time for your revenge fantasies .
i &apos;m just trying to save the world .
what about chapter nine ?
- you &apos;ll have to refresh my memory .
- chapter nine !
justice !
in k-drama , life is fair .
and if evil goes unconfronted by the end of a series , it will continue to affect other dramas , either directly or indirectly .
well , then , you had better confront him .
hello , everyone .
my name is seth , and i am the owner of the soon-to-open restaurant , seth &apos;s libertine .
i wanted to take a moment to thank you all for coming here to honor our friend , ga-in .
i &apos;d just like to say a few words before we say good-bye forever .
ga-in played an important part in all of our lives .
we &apos;ll never know what she was thinking in those last minutes .
the despair she must have felt ... to take her own life ...
let &apos;s choose to remember her at her best , though .
as i &apos;m sure ga-in herself would have wished of us .
rest in peace , ga-in .
and perhaps now ... we could hear from her fiancé ?
park joon , are you here ?
that son of a bitch .
dad ...
ga-in ...
i &apos;ve been trying to remember my happiest memories with each of you , but no matter how much i try , i seem to come up blank .
my only wish right now is ...
i know it sounds crazy ... but i wish i was able to stop time .
then i &apos;d go back in time to those happy moments and relive them with you .
but it &apos;s all over and done with .
no second chances .
everything &apos;s gone .
all gone !
what the hell do you want ?
justice .
you know ,
i &apos;ve been trying to figure out when things started going wrong , and it seems to line up with the day you appeared in my kitchen .
nice try , park joon . don &apos;t change the subject .
what ?
why did you do it , joon ?
what are you talking about ?
i know .
i should have known this whole time . i was just blinded by my feelings for you .
so blinded by your feelings that you tried to burn down my restaurant .
no , no , no , you don &apos;t get to sidestep the issue here , mister .
what issue , claire ?
that you &apos;re a murderer !
you &apos;re a murderer , park joon .
are you on drugs ?
the only drug that i &apos;m on is the truth .
that doesn &apos;t even make sense !
yeah ?
well , neither does killing your father ! or your fiancée !
and then you save my life so i won &apos;t be onto you , but i &apos;m onto you !
i didn &apos;t kill anyone !
then why weren &apos;t you at the memorial ?
because i broke it off with her !
because i didn &apos;t want to marry her .
and that &apos;s why she killed herself . because of me !
b.s. !
and why would i kill my father ?
i love my father .
so you wouldn &apos;t have to take over the company .
oh , you mean the company that i &apos;ve taken over ?
as opposed to the restaurant that i &apos;ve lost ?
well , then why would you save me ?
you ruined it !
this whole place is screwed because you saved me . you idiot !
you big , stupid idiot .
oh , i &apos;m an idiot ?
i &apos;m a big , stupid idiot ?
- yeah !
- yeah ?
then what are you ?
i &apos;m a ... bigger , stupider idiot !
so ...
we &apos;re all set for the reopening , right ?
of course .
seo-yeon .
let &apos;s give it our all . i really want this to work .
for us .
can i take you home ?
that &apos;s okay .
i &apos;ve got a few things on my mind and don &apos;t mind walking .
but thank you again for everything .
i &apos;ll see you .
do you believe me now ?
i thought i had finally figured it all out .
figured out what ?
chapter nine .
you are a strange woman .
you should dress up more often .
i feel like such a fraud .
she knew why i didn &apos;t want to marry her .
because she &apos;s the bitch ?
uh ... no .
because ...
joon , don &apos;t .
you can &apos;t . and you don &apos;t . you don &apos;t even know me .
exactly . you &apos;re a mystery .
every woman i &apos;ve ever met , i know what she &apos;s thinking ,
i know what she wants to hear , but with you ... you &apos;re different .
it &apos;s like you &apos;re an alien or something .
you need to shut up , joon .
even the way you say my name .
even these last few days when i hated you .
and i hated you more than i &apos;ve ever hated anything--
joon , stop .
even when you accused me of killing my own father .
and i don &apos;t think that would have been possible if i-- please .
don &apos;t .
look at me . no .
why ?
joon ...
do you not feel the same way ?
it isn &apos;t that .
then why ?
give me one reason why .
because if you didn &apos;t kill your father and ga-in , someone else did .
and justice must be served .
what &apos;s that ?
this is complicated .
and if i saw what you &apos;re about to see , i &apos;d probably lose my mind--
i ...
you &apos;ve been through a lot , and i don &apos;t know what else to do . rule number four .
and , and , and ... this is the most important of them all .
these characters cannot know they &apos;re in a drama . yeap !
i know .
who are you talking to ?
yeah , i know it &apos;s risky ... and the world could end , or our faces could spontaneously implode , or--
park joon !
yeah ?
i really hope this works .
you &apos;re ... park joon .
-the famous chef , right ? -what are you doing here ?

i &apos;m gonna see the kid .
surgery &apos;s on the third floor .
yeah , i know . oh ! hit the stairs ?
_removed_
there we go . oh , after you .
so , frankie injured his small bowel when he was thrown .
our surgeon &apos;s removing the damaged tissue now , so ... we adopted frankie . yeah .
_removed_
we got him , and ... he &apos;s part of us now .
if we lost him , joan will never forgive herself . she grew up pentecostal .
she thinks this is god punishing her .
i know how hard this is , but he &apos;s gonna make it .
i promise .
do me a favor , doc . if you have bad news , you tell me , not joan .
she can get a little hysterical .
yeah , of course , francis . you excuse me ? okay .
- hey .
- hey .
i just got frankie &apos;s labs .
_removed_
- does scott know ? - it &apos;s doubtful .
he &apos;s too busy putting him back together .
all right .
i just told frankie &apos;s dad he was gonna make it .
all right , mr. martinez , this might just be the flu , but we want to make sure it &apos;s nothing more serious , so we &apos;re gonna run a few more tests .
_removed_
a &quot; fright illness &quot; ? okay .
_removed_
i &apos;m not scared of nothing .
okay , well , i like your bracelets .
are they helping with your arthritis ?
all right , well , did she give you anything for your susto ?
well , i don &apos;t get it .
i mean , if you have a cure , why are you here ?
my patron won &apos;t let me work without a doctor &apos;s note .
i break horses .
my gramps did that .
he put them on a long rope , let them run , then bring it in a little at a time . they &apos;re like people .
they hate being told what to do . i like this girl .
she &apos;s smart .
_removed_
_removed_
he beat her when she was pregnant ?
and that &apos;s not against the law .
akmal is the law .
we shamed him by trying to leave , and after the baby comes , he will kill us both , unless i can get us to australia .
damn .
the uterine lac is extended .
my baby ?
how &apos;s my baby ? everyone is fine .
you have a visitor .
you didn &apos;t go ? without you , never .
the uterine lac is rapidly expanding .
how &apos;s he doing ?
removed the injured bowel , but he &apos;s oozing everywhere .
&apos;cause he has no platelets . he needs them to clot .
- these should help . - temp &apos;s up to 104 .
he went from freezing to burning up .
his white blood cell count is down , too .
you thinking what i &apos;m thinking ? traumatic bone marrow failure .
without working bone marrow , he can &apos;t make new blood cells , which means he can &apos;t clot or fight infection .
he needs a transplant . go test the parents for a match .
won &apos;t help , he &apos;s adopted .
well , then , try and track down his birth mother .
that &apos;s his best shot .
we can start him on antibiotics and slow the infection , but without a transplant .
_removed_
now , you sure you don &apos;t want us to put you under ?
you could wake up , and your son would be right here .
no , not with akmal around . i have to be awake to protect my son .
i would do the same thing .
you have kids , doctor ?
i do .
i have a daughter named riley in texas .
she &apos;s gonna be 13 in two weeks .
- i married akmal at 13 . - yeah ?
riley &apos;s gonna have a slumber party for her birthday .
it &apos;s gonna be no boys allowed .
drew :
your daughter &apos;s lucky to have such a strong role model .
the army &apos;s tough on women , especially moms .
yeah , well , if you don &apos;t push for change , it never happens . - you got that right .
- it still sucks .
she got fake nails , hair , boobs , the whole thing .
she wants riley to do beauty pageants .
aah . - baby wants out .
- is he okay ?
we have to start the surgery now .
so i want you to breathe like i showed you .
in through the nose ... out through your mouth .
starting low transverse incision .
through the nose , out through the mouth . aah !
tell me more about her ... riley .
well , she &apos;s ... she &apos;s tall , like her daddy , and she can beat up any boy in her class .
we got this , sharbat .
hey , topher .
you called for a surgical consult ? i did .
where &apos;s scott ? in surgery . i &apos;m covering the e.r. for him .
_removed_
i was 99 % sure it wasn &apos;t acutely surgical , so i sent him up .
okay . uh ...
if you ... you change your mind , then . hey !
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s hard to headline in your hometown .
i &apos;m from philly .
no , it &apos;s an expression .
you started as an intern , so everybody sees you as their little brother .
you want to be taken seriously , present with authority . you are a surgeon . own it .
_removed_
his sodium levels are good , which rules out hypernatremia .
did you check his herbs ?
rosemary and basil , all benign .
excuse me .
i &apos;m looking for augusto martinez .
- i &apos;m his daughter , carly . - one moment , please .
- thank you .
- here .
uh , excuse me , miss martinez ?
- yes . - i &apos;m dr. alexander .
this is dr. rivera .
we &apos;re helping your dad . is he okay ? i was in my office .
at 1 : 00 a.m. ?
i &apos;m in the middle of a big case .
he &apos;s lethargic , claims that his spirit was frightened from his body .
that stupid witch doctor .
well , did anything happen to him recently ?
was he in an accident ?
not that i know of . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s my client .
_removed_
how &apos;s she doing ? still sleepy .
yeah . - how &apos;s my son ? - he has an infection in his blood .
we &apos;re keeping it in check with antibiotics , but his bone marrow has gone into failure .
he can &apos;t make white cells to fight the infection .
he &apos;s gonna need a transplant .
we need to find his birth mother .
francis ? she was a drug addict .
it was a closed adoption .
we never met .
test me , maybe i &apos;m a match .
yeah , the chances of a random match are very slim .
okay , mr. martinez , your heart rate and your temperature are abnormally low , which is why you passed out .
- what &apos;s causing it ?
- hard to say .
_removed_
_removed_
i can &apos;t afford &apos; em . you don &apos;t have to , papi .
i don &apos;t want your money , carolina .
why not ?
because i &apos;m not cleaning houses like ernesto &apos;s daughter ?
or selling sugar pills like your witch doctor ?
okay , everybody , let &apos;s just focus here .
don &apos;t you look down your nose at me . not you , the con artists .
folk cures are placebos .
studies show hope helps patients get well .
_removed_
the only thing healthy here is her bank account . she &apos;s robbed him blind . at least she listens to him .
oh ! hey , kenny , i didn &apos;t , uh , see you . - dude .
- what ?
this thing has 50 grams of sugar .
it has 1 % daily riboflavin .
it &apos;s basically medicine .
how did you find me , anyway ?
_removed_
you know , this tracker , you &apos;d make a really good stalker , kenny .
_removed_
_removed_
she should take it easy , then .
_removed_
hey , brother . can you do me a favor ?
_removed_
but i already got one , dr. z. well , now you have two .
and look , it comes with this .
thanks , ray .
so , what the hell was that ?
you do not take sides in a family argument .
do you hear me ? she &apos;s bullying him .
my mom did that to my grandpa .
his voice was like a dog whistle to her .
shannon , you cannot bring emotion into this job . it clouds your judgment , and it can hurt your patient .
- so , be a robot .
- be professional .
i gave you a lot of leeway at the reservation clinic , but it is not gonna fly here .
_removed_
yeah , you &apos;re damn straight it won &apos;t .
annie : jordan !
annie .
i heard a rumor that you were back .
i &apos;m sober , five months now .
yeah , tc didn &apos;t mention it .
well , you guys have a lot of stuff to not ...
talk about besides me . i &apos;m sorry about everything that happened with ...
uh-uh , that &apos;s not necessary .
i know , i just ...
i-i got to say this , too .
hi , topher . oh , hey .
you always tried to help me , and i repaid you by being a total bitch , and look ...
i &apos;m really sorry .
i-i &apos;m not asking for forgiveness , jordan .
_removed_
i &apos;ll see ya .
i hope it works out , right ?
wow , i did not see that coming .
dr. alexander , my dad , he won &apos;t wake up !
_removed_
_removed_
hey , toph , i need frankie &apos;s adoption records asap so i can contact his birth mother .
does your cousin still clerk for the state ?
yeah , yeah , i &apos;ll ...
i &apos;ll call him right now , but i gotta be honest , dude .
_removed_
just try , okay ?
_removed_
- oh , my god !
- gwen ?
you okay ?
uh , yeah , yeah . have you seen kenny ?
i &apos;m dodging him , actually .
oh , he ran a patient up to radiology .
be back in 10 .
wait , you want me to leave him a message ?
happy to help .
he &apos;s beautiful , sharbat .
you did great .
cutting the umbilical cord .
here , let &apos;s clean him up .
_removed_
he &apos;s not breathing .
please help him ! we will .
we just need you to stay calm . i lost his pulse .
please , save my baby . please help him !
come on , buddy .
come on .
we need to push epi .
we don &apos;t have a line , so we &apos;ll go through the umbilical cord .
oh , my god .
- pushing the catheter . - what &apos;s happening ?
- please save him .
- tie it off , doctor .
okay , i &apos;m in .
come on .
_removed_
here we go .
- come on . come on .
_removed_
_removed_
there he is .
good set of lungs on him . no pneumonia or tumors .
what are all these bony abnormalities on the chest x-ray ?
scarring from old fractures .
_removed_
_removed_
okay , his heart rate keeps dropping .
let &apos;s give him 0.5 of atropine .
_removed_
we might need to pace him externally .
i talked to the chief of internal medicine at northwest , and she said that this is a &quot; beta blocker overdose , &quot;
and he needs glucagon right now .
okay , that &apos;s an interesting theory , except he &apos;s not on beta blockers .
then what &apos;s wrong with him ?
i don &apos;t have an answer . well , you better find one because if you don &apos;t ,
i &apos;m gonna sue you and this lousy excuse for a hospital for malpractice .
you know , maybe if you spent a little less time on that phone of yours and more time with him , he wouldn &apos;t be here .
do as i say , not as i do , right ?
smart-ass is a waste of my time .
all right , we &apos;ve obviously missed something , so let &apos;s run his labs again .
general rozenfeld called .
mark has told him both patients are in recovery .
i talked to omed . they can still make it to australia .
no , it &apos;s too late . akmal &apos;s gonna wake up any minute now .
actually , i miscalculated his weight during anesthesia .
i thought he was 220 . turns out he &apos;s 180 , so the post-op morphine might have been too much .
you dosed him ?
on whose orders ? my patient , my call , right ?
that &apos;s a beautiful name . it means hope .
what did you have in mind ?
dr. rivera ?
it &apos;s dr. cummings . dr. cummings .
somebody put on his big-boy pants .
try it some time , nurse fournette .
excuse me .
_removed_
thumb tack man .
i started removing the tacks , then got pulled into a critical case , handed it off to a nurse .
and why did you not call for a trauma consult ?
the wounds are all shallow .
i &apos;m sealing it with surgical glue . on whose authority ? you are an intern .
did you even check a chest x-ray for a pneumo , maybe ?
dude didn &apos;t want stitches , doctor , so i suggested another way .
the e.r. uses consultants for a reason , dr. rivera . 41 puncture wounds is a trauma .
next time , call me instead of asking a nurse , or i will note it in your resident file .
frankie &apos;s bleeding has stopped , but his bp is still dropping .
he &apos;s in shock . we need that match .
any luck finding the birth mother ?
no . francis said he didn &apos;t know . he was fuzzy on the whole thing .
couldn &apos;t remember her name or the adoption agency .
how do you forget where your kid came from ?
my parents could still tell you the address of their adoption lawyer .
well , exactly , so i spoke to toph &apos;s cousin , and the state has no adoption records for frankie .
he doesn &apos;t exist . that &apos;s impossible .
the courts keep records on everything .
i &apos;ve seen my own adoption records .
you know what else is weird ?
he made me promise not to talk to his wife , didn &apos;t want to upset her .
yeah , well , she completely freaked out when we told her that you had found frankie , tore her stitches .
that &apos;s a pretty extreme reaction .
_removed_
_removed_
joan ?
it &apos;s dr. callahan .
frankie needs your help .
_removed_
we need to find his birth family .
can you tell me why ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
_removed_
we all make mistakes .
usually , it &apos;s just we have to deal with them , but i don &apos;t care what you did back there .
i &apos;d trade my life for his .
then tell me about frankie , joan .
i was always meant to be a mother , but god wouldn &apos;t give me a baby .
and then one day , we were coming out of the movie theater , and there was frankie in a stroller .
and he smiled at me .
and i just knew , in my heart , he was mine .
_removed_
_removed_
i mean , i-i thought it was just tc being tc , but he was right and he found the truth .
chicago pd contacted the birth parents ,
_removed_
well , memories of their loss everywhere , who could blame them ?
yeah , they &apos;re on a plane right now from o &apos;hare .
that &apos;s three hours away . he won &apos;t make it that long .
fetal cord blood .
we were gonna save it , remember ? maybe frankie &apos;s birth parents saved his .
they &apos;re on a plane right now . we can &apos;t reach &apos; em .
we don &apos;t have to .
_removed_
i &apos;ll call .
good call , jordan . yeah , we always said it would come in handy .
i &apos;m sorry . ah .
i got to check on a patient .
excuse me .
miss martinez , i owe you an apology .
i had no right to talk to you like that . no .
you &apos;re right .
my dad and i would never talk .
my mom died when i was little .
it was just me and my dad .
he worked so hard so i could have everything i needed .
and you worked hard so he could stop .
made partner , bought a house in alamo heights , asked him to move in , but he wouldn &apos;t give up that ratty trailer at that ranch .
no matter what i do , he still cares more about his horses than me .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s true .
i &apos;m a lot like your dad .
you know , i work so i can avoid things , feel like i &apos;m in control .
that &apos;s why he won &apos;t leave the ranch , and why you are in the office until 1 : 00 a.m .
_removed_
his heart rate &apos;s in his 30s .
_removed_
_removed_
those fractures were the only abnormality .
_removed_
i got it .
_removed_
uh ...
there it is , a healed fracture of the hyoid bone .
his throat injury , plus bradycardia , plus hypothermia adds up to hypothyroidism .
okay , he &apos;s lost his pulse .
let &apos;s start cpr .
_removed_
come on , mr. martinez .
kenny ?

yeah , great .
_removed_
tough night .

_removed_
you know , sneaking sodas , ray the orderly ...
i get it . we &apos;re playing .
but smoking , man ? come on , man , it &apos;s just wrong .
i &apos;m gonna save you the speech , okay ?
i-i made a promise . i &apos;m just cheating myself .
i got small children , remember ?
oh , so that means you can act like one ?
please , i don &apos;t need a drill sergeant , okay ?
i was a ranger .
i ran 12 miles with a 60-pound pack in 3 hours .
where &apos;s that guy now ?
he &apos;s gone !
he &apos;s eaten up by long hours , small children , a wife who &apos;s pissed because my mom &apos;s visiting for a month .
- all right , we take 24 . - you guys take 17 .
- you &apos;re a grown man . if you want to quit , quit .
i don &apos;t need you giving me crap .
_removed_
they flew it in from austin . tc found it ?
what does he know ?
she should be able to walk in about a week or so .
i need you to give her the antibiotics three times a day when you change the dressing .
you remember how ?
_removed_
whoa , pump the brakes there , omed . just ...
there you go .
let &apos;s go , boys ! move it out !
so , they found a safe house in kabul ?
_removed_
wow . think they &apos;ll make it ?
they have a chance .
they didn &apos;t before .
_removed_
i would want someone to help her .
someone who did it because it was the right thing to do .
major .
captain .
general rozenfeld wants to see you .
we just got out of surgery . we need to change and shower .
sorry , he said now .
gen. rozenfeld :
you had strict orders not to meddle in local medical matters .
her husband wanted to take her to a midwife .
instead , you performed a c-section .
_removed_
with all due respect , sir , our partner nearly killed his wife and baby simply because he didn &apos;t want to be embarrassed .
_removed_
hell , i even respect what you did .
but the afghanis want your head on a stick . i have no choice .
captain alister , your tour is over .
sir , i have three months left on my tour .
you had three months . you &apos;ll be stateside next week .

&apos;cause if you don &apos;t , your susta might just come back .
oh , papi !
you want from dr. no to dr. phil .
what happened ?
stopped taking my own advice .
can i do that , too ? no .
in fact , you and i need to chat about some ground rules .
over tequila later .
oh , okay , well , i &apos;m down with that .
all right , get out of here , go do something .
okay , good .
how long have you been in chicago ?
um , we moved last year .
i can &apos;t imagine what you both have been through .

yeah . hey , how &apos;d that myxedema case of yours turn out ?
oh , we got him back . daughter &apos;s not suing .
how did you pull that off ? well , she &apos;s not a bitch or anything .
she just , you know , was trying to take control of a situation that she felt was out of her hands , which i get .
i spent my whole life trying to plan every little thing .
saying no to anything that i couldn &apos;t control , not letting myself make any mistakes .
after the baby and everything , i &apos;ve been even more like that .
well , you &apos;re just keeping your eyes on the prize .
what prize ... more work ?

( girl ) people once believed that when someone dies ... a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead .

i kept asking questions and ... finally got busted for sticking my nose where it wasn &apos;t wanted .
this your wife ?
yeah , we , uh-
- well , not anymore , we &apos;re getting a divorce .

we see ourselves as united nations of hospitality schools .
and we &apos;d like to think we teach a global and balanced perspective .
you &apos;re here because you have a dream .
we &apos;re here to help make that dream a reality .
yeah and i saw firsthand how the hospitality industry can really bring infrastructure to communities that need it .
but i also saw a lot of problems that they cause , which is why community groups need to be , involved every step of the way , and they need to be taken seriously .
and ?
i guess i want to help facilitate that and help give them a voice .

i didn &apos;t even know it was called that .
- how long were you on the train ?
- a couple of days .
a couple of days ?
saroo , what was your hometown again ?
ganestlay .
i must have had it wrong because it doesn &apos;t exist .
but there must be something else that you do remember .
the platform ...
i fell asleep on , there &apos;s a big rain tank .
it was only a few stops from ganestlay .
there are thousands of stations with rain tanks .
okay , it was a long time ago .
have you heard of this new program , google earth ?
it &apos;s incredible , you can find any place from anywhere .
listen to me , we can find out how fast passenger trains went back then .
we take that speed , multiply by the hours that you were on the train .
that &apos;s it !
we create a search radius .
and inside there , you will find the station with the rain tank .
yeah , but it will take a lifetime to search all the stations in india .
did i say all the stations ?
ok , even half the stations ..
really guys , i don &apos;t want to talk about this .
did your parents try to find you ?
- what ?
- they tried to find him .
no i just mean like , if they tried to find him , maybe they left like a paper trail .
what paper trail ?
- he didn &apos;t know his surname .
- my mum couldn &apos;t read or write .
what does she do ?
a labourer , she carried rocks .
your mum ?
my mom died about four years ago now .
i &apos;m sorry .
my dad is still so angry at her .
not for getting sick , obviously ... but just for refusing chemo .
but she just knew herself , you know ?
she knew what her terms were and she knew how she wanted to live , so ...
just couldn &apos;t accept that , i guess .
and how do you feel ?
i miss her .
and what do you think of bharat &apos;s search radius idea ?
what was that ?
is that your dance ? is that how you dance ?
oh , god !
you can &apos;t keep going on like this .
let me help you .
let &apos;s go for a run .

cheeky little thing .
pure energy .
but incredible .

he &apos;s been hard to control , but ... very , very smart ... and very ...
i mean , he could do anything if he just learned to control that energy .
he could do it , and do it all .
saroo is very protective of him .
i &apos;ve been blessed .
very blessed .
your mom showed me all your old little trophies .
mum , you didn &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t know you were so athletic .

how every day my real brother screams my name !
can you imagine the pain they must be in for not knowing where i am ?
25 years , luce . 25 !
why didn &apos;t you tell me that &apos;s was happening for you ?
and we swung about in our ... privileged lives .
it makes me sick .
i have to find home .
they need to know , okay ?
i &apos;ve never stopped you .
i want to help .
i can &apos;t do this anymore .
you deserve more .

saroo , you there , mate ?
it &apos;s one day international ( cricket ) tomorrow .
you can come over if you like ?
i meant to tell you , i fixed the tiller .
why don &apos;t we take her out ? we can head up the coast ?
hey , saroo ...
mate , your mum &apos;s not , um , look , we &apos;ve lost track of mantosh , he &apos;s missing again .
you know how worried she gets .
we know you quit your job , mate .
just worried about you , son .
i &apos;ve been visiting her .
every night i walk those streets home .
home from the dam .
home from the station .
i know now ... every single step of the way .
and i imagine that i &apos;m ... whispering in her ear ...
i &apos;m here , it &apos;s alright .
what was she like ?
beautiful .
how was new york ?
it &apos;s the same .
so , what brings you back ?
my funding came through .
it &apos;s great !
see ...
they know how good you are .
i miss you .
i saw your mom .
she &apos;s not doing very well .
i &apos;m worried , it would kill her if she knew i was searching .
you underestimate her .
she needs you .
no , give me five rupees then i &apos;ll carry them all
okay , you win , take this
he was carrying a watermelon and didn &apos;t see it coming
what ?
what if you do find home and they &apos;re not even there ?
and you never stop and keep searching ?
and you don &apos;t know what happens over time , things change , and entire worlds change .
i don &apos;t have a choice .
stay .
i can &apos;t .
stay right there
weren &apos;t you supposed to look after him ?
where were you ?
don &apos;t you love him ?
john heard mantosh is out on the boats .
doing a lobster run .
he &apos;s due back tomorrow .
so he &apos;ll be flushed with cash , back on the hard stuff .
i &apos;m sorry you couldn &apos;t have your own kids .
what are you saying ?
we ...
we ... weren &apos;t blank pages , were we ?
like your own would have been .
you weren &apos;t just adopting us but our past as well .
- i feel like , we &apos;re killing you .
- i could have had kids .
what ?
we chose not to have kids .
we wanted the two of you .
that &apos;s what we wanted .
we wanted the two of you in our lives .
that &apos;s what we chose .
that &apos;s one of the reasons , i fell in love with your dad .
because we both felt , as if ... the world has enough people in it .
have a child , couldn &apos;t guarantee it will make anything better .
but to take a child that &apos;s suffering like you boys were .
give you a chance in the world .
that &apos;s something .
i bet you never imagined it being this hard .
it &apos;s not a matter of hard .
it &apos;s not a mat ...
there &apos;s only one path for me .
and , that &apos;s how i think .
that &apos;s how this happened because ...
when i was 12 ,
i had a vision .
some people would say , it was a breakdown . but it ...
you know that , and he was like he wasn &apos;t a good man .
he was out of control when i was ...
i was standing at the back of the house .
i was looking out across this field .
and i just wanted the earth to swallow me up .
and i ...
i felt an electric current , it was like a shock , like a jolt through my whole body .
and then i saw ...
a brown skinned child across that field .
and he was standing beside me .
and it was right there and i could feel it so strongly .
and for the first time in my life i felt something good ...
i felt good .
and i knew it was guiding me .
and i knew that i was going to be fine .
it was , as if , that moment i could see my future , right there !
because i always thought that i could keep this family together .
and now ...
now i don &apos;t know .
where ...
- mum ...
- what &apos;s happening ? i don &apos;t understand .
you don &apos;t talk to me any more .
i need you , saroo .
mantosh !
sorry for what i said at dinner .
ganesh talai ...
ganesh talai .
ganestlay !
mum
i found home !
what ?
please wait for me .
i &apos;m here .
so this is where you &apos;ve been .
i don &apos;t want you to feel , i was ungrateful .
there wasn &apos;t a day , i didn &apos;t want to tell you .
saroo .
i really hope she &apos;s there .
she needs to see how beautiful you are !
hi , i used to live here .
i ... used to ...
can i help ?
that &apos;s me . i &apos;m saroo .
i used to live here .
- you lived here ?
- yes i used to live here .
i &apos;m looking for guddu , kallu , shekila .
my mother .
come .
come where ?
come with me .
just come .
saroo !
mum .
mum ? saroo ?
saroo ...
saroo !
oh , how i looked for you !
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
yes , the watermelon .
watermelon
tarabuja ! yes , tarabuja !
watermelon ...
guddu ?
where is guddu ?
where is he ?
guddu is no more .
he is with god .
shekila .
- shekila shekila ?
shekila ?
shekila ? - shekila ?
- he &apos;s your brother !
she &apos;s so big !
it &apos;s me , saroo .
beautiful .
hi , mum .
i know you will be sound asleep .
i just want to say that i &apos;m safe .
i &apos;m safe and the questions have been answered .
there are no more dead-ends .
i found my mother , and ... she thanks you both for raising me .
she understands that you are my family .
she &apos;s ... happy , just knowing i &apos;m alive .
i found her , but that doesn &apos;t change who you are .
i love you mum ... so much .
and you , dad .
and mantosh .
c &apos;mon !
let &apos;s go !
come on !
saroo !
let &apos;s go !
walk faster !
i &apos;m going , i &apos;m going , i &apos;m going !

we work at the embassy .
who was that ?
that was comrade vermes .
we want to go in .
we are comrade radó and comrade vermes .
trade department .
inspector lambert . bern police .
we &apos;re trying to negotiate with the intruders .
there &apos;s a telephone in the ambassador &apos;s apartment .
i &apos;ll call you in 2 minutes , and we &apos;ll try to find a peaceful solution .
i think you should talk to them .
ábel ?
i &apos;d prefer to talk to comrade vermes .
i &apos;d offer him a deal .
the ambassador &apos;s life in exchange for the combination to the safe .
he won &apos;t take it . i know him .
you &apos;ll convince him .
he doesn &apos;t give a shit if i live or die .
bános ...
you want to kill that man ?
are you chickening out ?
just thinking .
we &apos;ve killed before , it &apos;s not a pleasant feeling .
but if we kill this man , we have to be ready to die .
i &apos;m ready .
and you ?
_removed_
we swore to imre nagy that we &apos;d fight for the freedom of hungary to the last drop of blood .
if we have to die today , we &apos;ll die today .
who says we have to die today ?
if i &apos;d been shot on corvin lane , i wouldn &apos;t have made it to the mecsek hills .
if i hadn &apos;t survived the mecsek , i wouldn &apos;t be here today , you get it ?
you are chickening out .
all i &apos;m saying is that we should leave ourselves a way out .
i &apos;m going to talk to vermes .
you &apos;re a good kid .
i didn &apos;t mean to , but i heard .
i can tell .
you &apos;re different .
compared to what ?
compared to bános .
compared to him , i am .
i went to high school for 2 years before they kicked me out .
a year later , my kid brother was kicked out , too .
&quot; anti-establishment behaviour . &quot;
my father was fired from the print works .
he wasn &apos;t a member of the party . he raised his voice , they locked him up .
2 months in prison .
the takács family screw themselves !
no need to intern us , no need to line up against the wall .
a small tap on our back , we collapse on our own .
bános lived in üllő .
the russkies raped his mother in &apos; 45 .
his father tried to protect her , he was nearly beaten to death .
all this witnessed by an 8-year-old bános .
all i &apos;m saying is that i &apos;ll happily shoot you in the head if i have to but bános will also smash your face to pieces before he screws your wife .
that &apos;s the difference between us .
inspector lambert , bern police .
tibor bános . give me vermes .
vermes ?
stay calm .
vermes .
tell me the combination or the ambassador dies .

with the two of us ?
if this was all about the two of us ,
i would &apos;ve proposed to you 2 weeks ago on that bridge in holligen .
you would &apos;ve said yes .
we &apos;d buy a house in ittigen or bolligen .
we &apos;d have three kids .
florian , mathias and adrian .
okay , i don &apos;t fancy the name adrian either .
you &apos;re such a fool .
it &apos;ll be over soon .
will i see you again ?
say something .
you will .
i don &apos;t trust the swiss .
imperialists .
we have to get this thing sorted in the embassy on our own .
are you in ?
i &apos;m in .
i &apos;m listening .
i can only guess .
then take a good guess .
we &apos;ve waited enough . we &apos;re going in .

did you know ?
that they &apos;d order me back ? i had a hunch .
why did they order you back ?
because of &apos; 56 .
i threw the ávó officers out off the embassy on october 30 .
vermes , radó and the others .
why ?
because imre nagy said so .
he just wants to win some time .
i &apos;m telling the truth . why would i lie ?
to save your ass .
half a sandwich : salami .
430 forints in cash .
the communist manifesto , in hungarian .
and this .
it &apos;s the telegram logbook .
- isn &apos;t that what we wanted ?
- it &apos;s worth shit without the code book .
damn !
what does a code book suppose to look like ?
small , big , thin , thick ?
i don &apos;t know ! i don &apos;t know .
it depends on how complicated the codes are .
what do you need the code book for ?
if you steal it , the state department will change the codes by tomorrow .
the code book can save lives and expose the guilty .
and how do you plan to take it ?
stuff it into your underpants and walk out the door ?
this is radio free europe . are you there , ábel ?
yes . this is ábel .
success ?
we &apos;re checking the safe now .
we &apos;re in the studio . ready to go on air .
we need one more minute .
do you want to read the codes out on the free europe ?
live on air .
those traitors in munich are in on this too , huh ?
i can &apos;t believe it .
in a few minutes , comrade ambassador , the whole free world ... will know the codes of the hungarian state department .
all your dirty secrets will be exposed .
what does the code book look like ?
no idea .
this safe belongs to home affairs , i work for the state department .
if it &apos;s not in the safe , then vermes has it .
the ambassador &apos;s life in exchange for the code book !
i &apos;ve got bad news for you .
vermes has burnt the code book .
what did he say ?
vermes burnt the code book .
- ls there only one code book ?
- yes .
you &apos;re left with no other option .
you have to give yourselves up .
now what ?
we stay .
and if we have to die , the ambassador dies first .
have you got the code book ?
no .
i repeat : we don &apos;t have the code book .
in that case , i have to abort the broadcast .
give us one more minute .
one minute and we &apos;re out .
you &apos;d better surrender .
prisons here are like hotels at home .
now what ?
down with kádár ! down with kádár !
- thank you .
- you &apos;re welcome .
there &apos;s a change to the program .
ambassador mihály koroknai is going to speak .
what ? the ambassador to bern ?
he &apos;s going to publicly apologise for imre nagy &apos;s murder .
are you insane ?
- why don &apos;t we shoot him ?
- and then what ?
- we &apos;re trying to break out .
- are you determined to die ?
kádár &apos;s henchman ! kádár &apos;s henchman !
down with kádár ! down with kádár !
kádár = murderer
we &apos;re waiting for the ambassador .
we &apos;re ready .
you &apos;re going live . all the best !
let &apos;s do it .
what should i say ?
introduce yourself .
i don &apos;t have the permission to make any declaration .
- i just wanted to clarify that .
- your name ?
mihály koroknai , hungarian ambassador to bern .
two bandits are holding a gun to my head .
what happened at the embassy in 1956 ?
tell us what you wanted to say earlier .
what did imre nagy ask you to do ?
it wasn &apos;t imre nagy , it was the state department .
what did the state department ask you to do ?
to dismiss the home affairs staff from the embassy .
the ávó officers .
i was ordered to get rid of intelligence operatives .
- it &apos;s koroknai .
- koroknai ?
and ? did you throw them out ?
how ? what station is it ?
i sent them home , it &apos;s not a secret .
radio free europe .
when did this happen ?
on october 30 .
did you take the side of the revolution ?
i &apos;m a diplomat , i don &apos;t take sides .
i follow orders , that &apos;s all .
for rákosi and imre nagy equally ?
i swore on the hungarian flag .
what happens at the top is not my business .
i &apos;m a professional . i do my job .
do you consider the revolution to be a professional matter ?
why &apos;s that important ? who cares ?
do you weigh orders up before you carry them out ?
yes , i do , like all normal people .
did you agree with throwing the ávó out ?
i &apos;ll repeat
mihály ?
i followed an order .
did you agree or not ?
it &apos;s not easy to speak honestly with a gun to my head .
it &apos;s just as hard without a gun .
you don &apos;t want honesty from me , you want a confession .
relax ...
we &apos;re just talking .
thank you .
i don &apos;t understand what we &apos;re talking about .
- what ? live on air ?
- yes .
goddammit !
we &apos;re just two hungarians , away from home from the two sides of the trenches finally agreeing on something .
we both hate the ávó .
everybody hated the ávó , didn &apos;t they ?
especially the diplomats . that &apos;s no secret .
they &apos;re home affairs , we &apos;re the state department .
what are they doing in an embassy anyway ?
they don &apos;t speak languages , they don &apos;t manage matters .
all they do is spy on our staff .
snoops , that &apos;s what they are .
when i got the call on october 30 that the new order was to dismiss the ávó what was i supposed to say ?
i was happy .
i never thought that communism could end .
imre nagy was the greatest communist , wasn &apos;t he ?
he was a friend of gerő and rákosi . what was i supposed to think ?
haven &apos;t you heard about the revolution ?
the revolution happened differently for us .
we were far way .
we heard that the crowds were out on the streets , chasing the ávó away .
and what did you think would happen ?
they &apos;d get rid of the ávó and communism would remain .
a communism without the ávó .
what else should i have thought ?
on october 30 , the orders came from the same people ... as before and since .
then why do they want to fire you ?
good question .
you followed their orders and now they &apos;re getting rid of you ?
after a shameless , 18-month procedure , they came up ... with this outrageous and humiliating verdict .
you &apos;ll have me feeling sorry for you .
and imre nagy ?
what about him ?
what do you think of his execution ?
i can &apos;t apologise for others .
but what &apos;s your take on it ?
you fought for the same reason after all , didn &apos;t you ?
not exactly .
you both wanted to get rid of the ávó .
if you &apos;re outraged by getting unfairly fired for this , aren &apos;t you a bit upset about imre nagy getting executed ?
just because i &apos;m pissed off by it .
it &apos;s not the same .
what &apos;s not the same ?
imre nagy gave the order , i just carried it out .
you &apos;re just as responsible as the one who gave the order , don &apos;t you think ?
on that basis , a whole country could be called to account .
would you have executed imre nagy ?
let me say it again : i did not give the order .
- but you &apos;d carry it out .
- would you have carried it out ?
would you have executed him if you &apos;d been ordered ?
this conversation is over .
would you have killed imre nagy ?
- switch the radio off .
- say yes or no .
did he deserve to die ? did he deserve the rope ?
- would you have tied it around his neck ?
- kick the stool from under his feet ?
watch him fighting for his life ?
- if you &apos;d been given the order ...
- would you have killed imre nagy ?
it was a mistake to kill imre nagy .
say it again .
it was a mistake to kill imre nagy .
a bloody big mistake .
i struggled ,
i pleaded , at headquarters , with the minister , with kádár .
i told him it would be a huge mistake to execute imre nagy .
&quot; he &apos;s just a tired old man , wouldn &apos;t hurt a fly . &quot;
&quot; people will forget him quickly . &quot;
kádár said :
&quot; we don &apos;t understand you , comrade koroknai . &quot;
&quot; imre nagy is a rat , an enemy of the state . &quot;
&quot; he has to die , right away . &quot;
i said : &quot; comrade kádár ... what will we achieve by executing him ? &quot;
&quot; we &apos;d only make the counter-revolutionaries stronger . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;d shake the immigrants up . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;d give them something one hundred times stronger than a tired old man . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;d give them a martyr . &quot;
don &apos;t ...
listen .
( lyrics of hungarian folk song about lajos kossuth )
&quot; if he sends this message again , &quot;
&quot; we all have to join his army . &quot;
&quot; long live the hungarian freedom ! &quot;
&quot; long live the homeland ! &quot;
&quot; raindrops are falling all around , &quot;
&quot; falling on lajos kossuth &apos;s hat . &quot;
leave yourself a way out .
what happened in there ?
i demand that you search him immediately .
the other one ?
what other one ?
go !
we &apos;re with you !
we &apos;re with you !
would you really have let them kill me ?
i was bluffing .
where was that goddamn code book ?
you must have figured it out by now , comrade ambassador .
enjoy packing your bags .
_removed_
you can put the new curtains up , edina .
we &apos;re staying .
headquarters sent a telegram .
&quot; earlier order retracted . &quot;
&quot; in light of heroic efforts ... &quot;
&quot; the ambassador stays . &quot;
i told you . i won &apos;t let them get me .
the code book was right in front of us all along .
it was in our hands .
we were blind not to realise .
it doesn &apos;t matter anymore .
my best friend is dead .
maybe it was determined by fate maybe by him .
bános was definitely ready .
he was ready to give his life for freedom .
i know that his death was not in vain .
tibor bános was given a public burial in bern on august 28 , 1958 , despite the protestation of the embassy .
hundreds of hungarian immigrants attended .
ábel takács was released 18 months later .
he gained swiss citizenship , attended university , and married .
he wasn &apos;t able to attend either his father &apos;s or his mother &apos;s funeral .
he could only return to hungary in 1989 .
mihály koroknai and györgy vermes were awarded the medal of worker and peasant rule for
&quot; exemplary , self-sacrificing and heroic behaviour &quot; .
koroknai &apos;s career went from strength to strength .
he served as ambassador in prague , belgrade and finally moscow .
he retired as deputy prime minister .
following the political amnesty granted in 1963 ,
hungary &apos;s un mandate was restored .
the &quot; hungarian question &quot; was taken off the agenda .

didn &apos;t your mother ever tell you not to play with your food ?
what do you want ?
i &apos;m here to announce that king mufasa &apos;s on his way , so you &apos;d better have a good excuse for missing this morning &apos;s ceremony .
oh , look , zazu .
you &apos;ve made me lose my lunch . you &apos;ll lose more than that when the king gets through with you .
he &apos;s as mad as a hippo with a hernia .
i quiver with fear !
now , scar , don &apos;t look at me that way .
_removed_
drop him . impeccable timing , your majesty .
why , if it isn &apos;t my big brother descending from on high to mingle with the commoners .
sarabi and i didn &apos;t see you at the presentation of simba .
that was today ?
must &apos;ve slipped my mind .
yes , well , as slippery as your mind is , as the king &apos;s brother , you should &apos;ve been first in line !
well , i was first in line , until the little hairball was born .
that hairball is my son and your future king .
i shall practice my curtsy !
don &apos;t turn your back on me , scar .
oh , no , mufasa . perhaps you shouldn &apos;t turn your back on me .
is that a challenge ?
temper , temper . i wouldn &apos;t dream of challenging you .
pity .
why not ? well , as far as brains go , i got the lion &apos;s share .
but when it comes to brute strength ...
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m at the shallow end of the gene pool .
there &apos;s one in every family , sire .

one day , simba , the sun will set on my time here and will rise with you as the new king .
and this &apos;ll all be mine ?
everything . everything the light touches .
what about that shadowy place ?
that &apos;s beyond our borders .
you must never go there , simba .
i thought a king can do whatever he wants . oh , there &apos;s more to being king than getting your way all the time .
- there &apos;s more ?
everything you see exists together in a delicate balance .
as king , you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures , from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope .
but , dad , don &apos;t we eat the antelope ?
yes , simba , but let me explain .
when we die , our bodies become the grass , and the antelope eat the grass .
and so we are all connected in the great circle of life .
good morning , sire !
good morning , zazu .
checking in with the morning report .

&quot; elephants remember

&quot; crocodiles are snapping up

&quot; shown interest in my nest egg
&quot; but i quickly said no thanks
&quot; we haven &apos;t paid the hornbills

everything . he didn &apos;t show you what &apos;s beyond that rise at the northern border ?
well , no .
he said i can &apos;t go there .

why not ? i &apos;m only looking out for the well-being of my favourite nephew .
yeah , right !

oops !

well , i suppose you &apos;d have found out sooner or later , you being so clever and all .
just do me one favour . promise me you &apos;ll never visit that dreadful place .

not so long as i &apos;m around .
in that case , you &apos;re fired .
nice try , but only the king can do that .
well , he &apos;s the future king .
yeah , so you have to do what i tell you .
not yet , i don &apos;t .
and with an attitude like that , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re shaping up to be a pretty pathetic king , indeed .
not the way i see it .
&quot; i &apos;m gonna be a mighty king

i thought you were very brave .
_removed_
yes , sire ?
take nala home . i &apos;ve got to teach my son a lesson .
come , nala .
simba ... good luck .
simba , i &apos;m very disappointed in you .
- i know .
- you could &apos;ve been killed .
you deliberately disobeyed me , and what &apos;s worse , you put nala in danger .
i was just trying to be brave , like you .
i &apos;m only brave when i have to be .
being brave doesn &apos;t mean you go looking for trouble .
i was today .
- you were ?
- yes . i thought i might lose you .
i guess even kings get scared .
- but you know what ?
- what ? i think those hyenas were even scareder .
cos nobody messes with your dad .
- come here , you .
gotcha !
dad ?
- we &apos;re pals , right ?
- right . and we &apos;ll always be together , right ?
simba , let me tell you something that my father told me .
look at the stars .
the great kings of the past look down on us from those stars .
- really ?
- yes .
so whenever you feel alone , just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you .
man , that lousy mufasa .
i won &apos;t be able to sit for a week .
it &apos;s not funny , ed .
shut up !
will you knock it off ?
- well , he started it .
- look at you guys . no wonder we &apos;re dangling at the bottom of the food chain .
man , i hate dangling .
yeah ? if it weren &apos;t for those lions , we &apos;d be runnin &apos; the joint .
man , i hate lions .
- so pushy .
- and hairy .
- and stinký .
- and , man , are they ...
surely we lions are not all that bad .
oh , scar .
it &apos;s just you . we were afraid it was somebody important .
yeah , you know , like mufasa .
- yeah .
- i see .
- now that &apos;s power !
- tell me about it . i just hear that name and i shudder .
do it again .
it tingles me .
_removed_
now , you , scar , i mean , you &apos;re one of us .
i mean , you &apos;re our pal .
charmed .
oh , i like that . he &apos;s not king , but he &apos;s still so proper .
hey , did you bring us anýthing to eat ,
scar , old buddy , old pal ?
did ya ? i don &apos;t think you really deserve this .
i practically gift-wrapped those cubs for you , and you couldn &apos;t even dispose of them .
well , you know ... it wasn &apos;t exactly like they was alone , scar .
yeah .
what were we supposed to do ?
precisely .
&quot; i know that your powers of retention
&quot; are as wet as a warthog &apos;s backside
&quot; but thick as you are , pay attention
&quot; my words are a matter of pride
&quot; it &apos;s clear from your vacant expressions
&quot; the lights are not all on upstairs
&quot; but we &apos;re talking kings and successions
&quot; even you can &apos;t be caught unawares
&quot; so prepare for the chance of a lifetime
&quot; be prepared for sensational news
&quot; a shiny new era is tiptoeing nearer
and where do we feature ? &quot; just listen to teacher
&quot; i know it sounds sordid
&quot; but you &apos;ll be rewarded &quot; when at last i am given my dues
&quot; and injustice deliciously squared
&quot; be prepared
yeah , be prepared .
we &apos;ll be prepared .
for what ?
for the death of the king .
- why , is he sick ?
- no , fool , we &apos;re going to kill him .
- and simba , too .
- great idea .
who needs a king ? &quot; no king , no king
- idiots !
there will be a king !
- but you said ... i will be king !
stick with me , and you &apos;ll never go hungry again .
- yeah !
all right !
- long live the king ! long live the king !
&quot; it &apos;s great that we &apos;ll soon be connected
&quot; with a king who &apos;ll be all-time adored
&quot; of course , quid pro quo , you &apos;re expected
&quot; to take certain duties on board
&quot; the future is littered with prizes
&quot; and though i &apos;m the main addressee
&quot; the point that i must emphasise is
&quot; you won &apos;t get a sniff without me !
&quot; so prepare for the coup of the century
&quot; be prepared for the murkiest scam
&quot; meticulous planning &quot; tenacity spanning
&quot; decades of denial
&quot; is simply why i &apos;ll be king undisputed
&quot; respected , saluted
&quot; and seen for the wonder i am
&quot; yes , my teeth and ambitions are bared
&quot; be prepared
&quot; yes , our teeth and ambitions are bared
&quot; be prepared
you wait here .
your father has a marvellous surprise for you .
what is it ? if i told you , it wouldn &apos;t be a surprise now , would it ?
if you tell me , i &apos;ll still act surprised .
you are such a naughty boy .
- come on , uncle scar .
- no , no , no , no , no . this is just for you and your daddy .
you know , a sort of father-son ... thing .
well , i &apos;d better go get him .
- i &apos;ll go with you .
- no .
no . just stay on this rock .
you wouldn &apos;t want to end up in another mess like you did with the hyenas .
- you know about that ? - simba , everybody knows about that .
- really ?
- oh , yes . lucký daddy was there to save you , eh ?
oh , and just between us , you might want to work on that little roar of yours .
ok .
hey , uncle scar , will i like this surprise ?
simba , it &apos;s to die for .
shut up .
i can &apos;t help it .
i &apos;m so hungry .
i got to have a wildebeest .
stay put . can &apos;t i just pick off one of the little sick ones ?
no . we wait for the signal from scar .
there he is .
let &apos;s go . &quot; little roar &quot; !
look , sire , the herd is on the move .
- odd .
- mufasa , quick .
stampede in the gorge . simba &apos;s down there .
zazu , help me !
your father is on the way !
hold on !
there !
there on that tree !
oh , scar , this is awful !
what &apos;ll we do ?
i &apos;ll go back for help , that &apos;s what i &apos;ll do .
dad !
_removed_
brother !
long live the king .
no !
dad !
dad , come on .
you got to get up .
we got to go home .
help !
somebody !
anybody .
help .
simba .
what have you done ?
there were wildebeests , and he tried to save me .
it was an accident . i didn &apos;t mean for it to happen .
of course .
of course you didn &apos;t .
no one ever means for these things to happen .
but the king is dead .
and if it weren &apos;t for you , he &apos;d still be alive .
what will your mother think ?
- what am i going to do ?
- run away , simba .
run . run away and never return .
kill him .
hey , there he goes .
so go get him .
there ain &apos;t no way i &apos;m going in there .
what , you want me to come out looking like you , cactus butt ?
but we got to finish the job .
well , he &apos;s as good as dead out there anyway .
and if he comes back , we &apos;ll kill him .
yeah !
you hear that ? if you ever come back , we &apos;ll kill you !
mufasa &apos;s death is a terrible tragedy .
but to lose simba , who had barely begun to live ...
for me , it is a deep , personal loss .
so it is with a heavy heart that i assume the throne .
yet out of the ashes of this tragedy we shall rise to greet the dawning of a new era in which lion and hyena come together in a great and glorious future .
get out of here !
i love this !
bowling for buzzards . gets &apos; em every time .
hey , timon , you better come look .
i think it &apos;s still alive .
all righty , what have we got here ?
jeez , it &apos;s a lion !
run , pumbaa , move it !
hey , timon , it &apos;s just a little lion .
look at him . he &apos;s so cute and all alone .
- can we keep him ?
- pumbaa , are you nuts ?
you &apos;re talking about a lion .
lions eat guys like us .
- but he &apos;s so little .
- he &apos;s going to get bigger . maybe he &apos;ll be on our side .
that &apos;s the stupidest thing i ever heard .
maybe he &apos;ll ...
hey , i &apos;ve got it . what if he &apos;s on our side ?
you know , having a lion around might not be such a bad idea .
so we &apos;re keeping him ?
of course . who &apos;s the brains of this outfit ?
my point exactly .
jeez , i &apos;m fried .
let &apos;s get out of here and find some shade .
- you ok , kid ?
- i guess so .
you nearly died .
i saved you . well , pumbaa helped .
a little .
thanks for your help .
hey , where you going ?
_removed_
gee , he looks blue .
- i &apos;d say brownish gold .
- no . i mean he &apos;s depressed .
what &apos;s eating you ?
nothing . he &apos;s at the top of the food chain .
the food chain !
so , where you from ?
_removed_
i can &apos;t go back . you &apos;re an outcast .
that &apos;s great .
so are we .
- what &apos;d you do , kid ?
- something terrible . - but i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
- we don &apos;t want to hear about it .
come on , timon .
anýthing we can do ? not unless you can change the past .
you know , kid , in times like this , my buddy timon here says you got to put your behind in your past .
no , no , no .
- i mean ...
- amateur . lie down before you hurt yourself .
it &apos;s you got to put your past behind you .
look , kid , bad things happen , and you can &apos;t do anýthing about it , right ?
- right .
- wrong !
when the world turns its back on you , you turn your back on the world .
well , that &apos;s not what i was taught .
then maybe you need a new lesson .

&quot; when i was a young warthog
- very nice .
- thanks . &quot; he found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
&quot; he could clear the savanna after every meal
&quot; i &apos;m a sensitive soul
&quot; though i seem thick-skinned
&quot; and it hurt that my friends never stood downwind
- &quot; and , oh , the shame - &quot; he was ashamed
- &quot; thought of changing my name - &quot; oh , what &apos;s in a name ?
&quot; and i got downhearted
- &quot; how did you feel ?
- &quot; every time that i ... pumbaa , not in front of the kids .

&quot; big ones , small ones , some as big as your head
i would never have had to do this with mufasa .
what ? what did you say ?
- nothing .
- you know the law .
never ever mention that name in my presence .
i am the king ! yes , sire , you are the king .
i ... only mentioned it to illustrate the differences in your royal managerial approaches .
- hey , boss .
- oh , what is it this time ?
- we got a bone to pick with you .
- i &apos;ll handle this . scar , there &apos;s no food , no water .
yeah . it &apos;s dinnertime , and we ain &apos;t got no stinking entrées .
it &apos;s the &quot; lionesses &quot; job to do the hunting .
- yeah , but they won &apos;t go hunt .
- oh , eat zazu . oh , you wouldn &apos;t want me .
i &apos;d be so tough and gamy and ...
oh , zazu , don &apos;t be ridiculous .

simba , what do you think ?
well , i don &apos;t know .
oh , come on .
give .
come on . we told you ours .

- yeah , pretty dumb , huh ?
you &apos;re killing me .

how do you do ?
time out ! let me get this straight .
you know her , she knows you .
but she wants to eat him , and everybody &apos;s ok with this ?
- did i miss something ?
- relax , timon . wait till everyone finds out you &apos;ve been here all this time .
and your mother - what will she think ?
she doesn &apos;t have to know .
nobody has to know .
of course they do .
everyone thinks you &apos;re dead .
they do ?
yeah . scar told us about the stampede .
he did ? what else did he tell you ?
what else matters ? you &apos;re alive .
and that means ... you &apos;re the king .
king ? lady , have you got your lions crossed .
king ?
your majesty , i gravel at your feet .
- stop it . - it &apos;s not gravel , it &apos;s grovel .
and don &apos;t !
he &apos;s not the king .
are you ? - no .
- simba !
no , i &apos;m not the king .
maybe i was gonna be , but that was a long time ago .
let me get this straight .
you &apos;re the king ? and you never told us ?
- look , i &apos;m still the same guy .
- but with power . could you guys excuse us for a few minutes ?
whatever she has to say , she can say in front of us , right , simba ?
maybe you &apos;d better go .
it starts .
you think you know a guy ...
timon and pumbaa - you learn to love &apos; em .
what ? what is it ?
it &apos;s like you &apos;re back from the dead .
you don &apos;t know how much this will mean to everyone .
what it means to me .
- hey , it &apos;s ok .
- i &apos;ve really missed you .
i &apos;ve missed you , too .
i tell you , pumbaa .
this stinks .
oh , sorry .
not you !
them ! him , her , alone .
what &apos;s wrong with that ?
- &quot; i can see what &apos;s happening
- what ? - &quot; and they don &apos;t have a clue
- who ?
&quot; they &apos;ll fall in love and here &apos;s the bottom line
&quot; our trio &apos;s down to two
&quot; the sweet caress of twilight
&quot; there &apos;s magic everywhere
&quot; and with all this romantic atmosphere
&quot; disaster &apos;s in the air
&quot; can you feel the love tonight ?
&quot; the peace the evening brings
&quot; the world , for once
&quot; in perfect harmony
&quot; with all its living things
&quot; so many things to tell her
&quot; but how to make her see
&quot; the truth about my past ...
&quot; impossible , she &apos;d turn away from me
&quot; he &apos;s holding back , he &apos;s hiding
&quot; but what , i can &apos;t decide
&quot; why won &apos;t he be the king i know he is ?
&quot; the king i see inside ?
&quot; can you feel the love tonight ?
&quot; the peace the evening brings
&quot; the world , for once
&quot; in perfect harmony
&quot; with all its living things
&quot; can you feel the love tonight ?
&quot; you needn &apos;t look too far
&quot; stealing through
&quot; the night &apos;s uncertainties
&quot; love is where they are
&quot; and if he falls in love tonight
&quot; it can be assumed
&quot; his carefree days
&quot; with us are history
&quot; in short , our pal
&quot; is doomed
isn &apos;t this a great place ?
it is beautiful .
but i don &apos;t understand something .
you &apos;ve been alive all this time .
why didn &apos;t you come back to pride rock ?
well , i just needed to get out on my own , live my own life .
and i did , and it &apos;s great .
we &apos;ve really needed you at home .
- no one needs me .
- yes , we do .
you &apos;re the king .
nala , we &apos;ve been through this .
i &apos;m not the king .
simba , he let the hyenas take over the pride lands .
- what ? - everything &apos;s destroyed .
there &apos;s no food , no water .
if you don &apos;t do something soon , everyone will starve .
- i can &apos;t go back .
- why ? - you wouldn &apos;t understand .
- what ?
no , no , no .
_removed_
_removed_
it &apos;s something i learned out here .
sometimes bad things happen and there &apos;s nothing you can do about it .
so why worry ?
- because it &apos;s your responsibility .
- well , what about you ?
you left . i left to find help , and i found you .
don &apos;t you understand ? you &apos;re our only hope .
- sorry .
- what &apos;s happened to you ?
- you &apos;re not the simba i remember .
- you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m not . - now are you satisfied ?
- no .
just disappointed .
you know , you &apos;re starting to sound like my father .
good . at least one of us does .
you think you can just show up and tell me how to live my life ?
you don &apos;t even know what i &apos;ve been through .
i would if you &apos;d just tell me .
- forget it !
she &apos;s wrong .
i can &apos;t go back .
what would it prove , anyway ? it won &apos;t change anýthing .
you can &apos;t change the past .
you said you &apos;d always be there for me !
but you &apos;re not .
and it &apos;s because of me .
it &apos;s my fault .
_removed_
come on , will you cut it out ?
can &apos;t cut it out .
it &apos;ll grow right back .
creepy little monkey .
will you stop following me ?
- who are you ?
- the question is , who ... are you ?
i thought i knew .
now i &apos;m not so sure .
well , i know who you are .
come here . it &apos;s a secret .
_removed_
what is that supposed to mean , anyway ?
it means you are a baboon , and i &apos;m not .
i think you &apos;re a little confused .
wrong !
i &apos;m not the one who &apos;s confused .
- you don &apos;t even know who you are .
- oh , and i suppose you know .
sure do .
you &apos;re mufasa &apos;s boy .
- bye .
- hey , wait !
you knew my father ?
correction
- i know your father .
i hate to tell you this , but he died ... a long time ago .
nope .
wrong again !
he &apos;s alive , and i &apos;ll show him to you .
you follow old rafiki .
he knows the way .
come on !
don &apos;t dawdle .
hurry up !
- wait .
- come on .
would you slow down ?
stop !
look down there .
that &apos;s not my father .
that &apos;s just my reflection .
no .
look harder .
you see ?
he lives in you .
father ?
simba , you have forgotten me .
no .
how could i ?
you have forgotten who you are , and so have forgotten me .
look inside yourself , simba .
you are more than what you have become .
you must take your place in the circle of life .
how can i go back ? i &apos;m not who i used to be .
remember who you are .
you are my son and the one true king .
remember who you are .
no !
please , don &apos;t leave me !
remember .
father !
don &apos;t leave me .
what was that ?
the weather .
- very peculiar , don &apos;t you think ?
looks like the winds are changing .
change is good .
yeah , but it &apos;s not easy .
i know what i have to do but going back means i &apos;ll have to face my past .
i &apos;ve been running from it for so long .
what was that for ?
it doesn &apos;t matter . it &apos;s in the past .
yeah , but it still hurts .
oh , yes , the past can hurt .
but the way i see it you can either run from it or ...
learn from it .
you see ? so what are you going to do ?
first , i &apos;m gonna take your stick .
no !
not the stick !
- where are you going ?
- i &apos;m going back !
good !
go on !
get out of here !
grubs !
hey , wake up .
it &apos;s ok !
it &apos;s ok !
it &apos;s me !
don &apos;t ever do that again .
carnivores !
- have you guys seen simba ?
- i thought he was with you .
he was , but now i can &apos;t find him .
where is he ?
you won &apos;t find him here !
the king has returned .
i can &apos;t believe it .
he &apos;s gone back !
gone back ? what do you mean ?
hey , what &apos;s goin &apos; on here ?
- who &apos;s the monkey ?
- simba &apos;s gone to challenge scar .
_removed_
- who &apos;s got a scar ?
- no , it &apos;s his uncle .
- the monkey &apos;s his uncle ?
_removed_
simba , wait up !
- it &apos;s awful , isn &apos;t it ?
- i didn &apos;t want to believe you .
what made you come back ?
i finally got some sense knocked into me , and i &apos;ve got the bump to prove it .
besides , this is my kingdom .
if i don &apos;t fight for it , who will ?
- i will .
- it &apos;s gonna be dangerous .
danger ? i laugh in the face of danger .
i see nothing funny about this .
timon , pumbaa , what are you doing here ?
at your service , my liege .
we &apos;re gonna fight your uncle ... for this ?
yes , timon .
this is my home .
talk about your fixer-upper .
well , simba , if it &apos;s important to you , we &apos;re with you to the end .
- hyenas .
i hate hyenas .
- so what &apos;s your plan for getting past those guys ?
- live bait .
- good idea .
come on , timon .
you guys have to create a diversion .
do you want me to dress in drag and do the hula ?
&quot; if you &apos;re hungry for juicy meat
&quot; eat pumbaa because he is a treat
&quot; come on down and dine on this tasty swine
&quot; all you have to do is get in line
&quot; are you achin&apos;
&quot; for some bacon ?
&quot; he &apos;s a big pig
&quot; you could be a big pig , too !
nala , you find my mother and rally the lionesses .
i &apos;ll look for scar .
_removed_
yes , scar ?
where is your hunting party ? they &apos;re not doing their job .
scar , there is no food .
the herds have moved on .
no , you &apos;re just not looking hard enough .
it &apos;s over .
there is nothing left .
we have only one choice .
we must leave pride rock .
- we &apos;re not going anywhere .
- you have sentenced us to death .
- then so be it .
- you can &apos;t do that .
i am the king .
i can do whatever i want .
if you were half the king mufasa was ...
i &apos;m ten times the king mufasa was !
mufasa ? no , you &apos;re dead .

simba !
you &apos;re alive ? how can that be ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;m home .
i &apos;m a little surprised to see you ... alive .
give me one good reason why i shouldn &apos;t rip you apart .
oh , simba , you must understand .
the pressures of ruling a kingdom ...
are no longer yours . step down , scar .
oh , well , i would , naturally .
however , there is one little problem .
you see them ?
they think i &apos;m king .
well , we don &apos;t .
simba &apos;s the rightful king .
the choice is yours , scar .
either step down or fight .
oh , must this all end in violence ?
i &apos;d hate to be responsible for the death of a family member .
- wouldn &apos;t you agree , simba ?
- that &apos;s not gonna work , scar .
i &apos;ve put it behind me .
but what about your faithful subjects ?
have they put it behind them ?
simba , what is he talking about ?
so you haven &apos;t told them your little secret .
well , simba , now &apos;s your chance to tell them .
tell them who is responsible for mufasa &apos;s death .
i am .
it &apos;s not true .
tell me it &apos;s not true .
- it &apos;s true .
- you see ? he admits it !
- murderer !
- no !
it was an accident .
if it weren &apos;t for you , mufasa would be alive .
it &apos;s your fault he &apos;s dead !
- do you deny it ?
- no .
- then you &apos;re guilty .
- no , i &apos;m not a murderer !
oh , simba , you &apos;re in trouble again , but this time daddy isn &apos;t here to save you , and now everyone knows why !
now , this looks familiar .
where have i seen this before ? let me think .
oh , yes .
i remember .
this is just the way your father looked before he died .
and here &apos;s my little secret .
i killed mufasa .
murderer !
- no , simba , please .
- tell them the truth .
truth ? but truth is in the eye of the behold ...

excuse me .
pardon me .
comin &apos; through . hot stuff .
- let me out !
- let me in !
please , don &apos;t eat me .
drop &apos; em !
- hey , who &apos;s the pig ?
- are you talkin &apos; to me ?
- he called him a pig !
- are you talking to me ?
- shouldn &apos;t have done that .
- are you talking to me ?
- now they &apos;re in for it .
- they call me ... mr pig !

- murderer .
- simba , please .
- please , have mercy .
i beg you .
- you don &apos;t deserve to live .
but , simba , i am ... family .
it &apos;s the hyenas who are the real enemy .
it was their fault .
it was their idea .
why should i believe you ?
everything you ever told me was a lie .
what are you going to do ?
you wouldn &apos;t kill your own uncle .
no , scar .
i &apos;m not like you .
oh , simba , thank you .
you are truly noble .
