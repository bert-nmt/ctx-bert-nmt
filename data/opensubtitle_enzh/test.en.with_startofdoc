we &apos;re lost .
no .
this is a short cut ...
babe , it &apos;s just we &apos;ve been on this road over an hour , and we haven &apos;t seen a single car .
molly , i know how to read a frickin &apos; map , okay ?
we passed a gas station a while back .
let &apos;s just go ask someone .
that was 40 minutes ago .
we &apos;re not turning around .
come on .
isn &apos;t this argument a little archaic ?
men can ask directions these days .
no , we can &apos;t .
it &apos;s against our genetic code .
look , i know exactly where we are .
oh , yeah ? where ?
highway 99 , okay ?
it cuts right through .
highway 99 , huh ?
okay , so we &apos;re taking the scenic route .
_removed_
it &apos;s our anniversary , and we &apos;re spending it stuck in the car .
i know .
i &apos;m sorry .
let me make it up to you , okay ?
come here .
stop . i &apos;m mad at you .
oh , come on , molly .
hey , you love me .

i &apos;m so sorry .
i didn &apos;t see you there .
are you ...
are you hurt ?
sir ?
stop !
stop !
holy
you &apos;ve got to help me .
please .
please ! all right , all right .
calm down , calm down .
tell us what happened .
i-i swerved , a-and we crashed .
and when i came to , the car was wrecked and my husband was missing .
i went looking for him , but that &apos;s when the man from the road , he ... he started chasing me .
did he look like he lost a fight with a lawn mower ?
how did you know that ?
lucky guess .
ma &apos;am , what &apos;s your name ?
_removed_
_removed_
i think maybe you should come with us .
we &apos;ll take you back into town .
_removed_
he might have gone back to the car .
well , we should get you somewhere safe first .
and then dean and i &apos;ll come back here . we &apos;ll look for your husband .
no .
i &apos;m not leaving here without him .
would you just take me back to my car , please ?
of course .
come on .
it &apos;s right over there .
i don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;m sure this is where it was .
w-we hit that tree right there .
this ... this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
dean , we got to get out of here .
greeley could show up at any second .
what are you gonna tell her .
the truth ?
she &apos;s gonna take off running in the other direction .
i know it sounds crazy , but i crashed into that tree .
i don &apos;t know who could &apos;ve taken it .
it was totaled .
please . you have to believe me .
molly , listen , we do believe you .
but that &apos;s why we want to get you out of here .
what about david ?
something must have happened .
i have to get to the cops .
cops ... that &apos;s a great idea .
we &apos;ll take you down to the station ourselves .
so just come with us .
it &apos;s the best way we can help you and your husband .
okay .
we &apos;re supposed to be in lake tahoe .
you and david ?
it &apos;s our five-year anniversary .
hell of an anniversary .
right before , we were having the dumbest fight .
it was the only time we ever really argued ... when we were stuck in the car .
yeah .
i know how that goes .
you know the last thing i said to him ?
i called him a jerk .
oh , god .
what if that &apos;s the last thing i said to him ?
_removed_
we &apos;re gonna figure out what happened to your husband .
i promise .
did you ?
no .
i was afraid you &apos;d say that .
this song .
what ?
it was playing when we crashed .
she &apos;s mine .
she &apos;s mine .
she &apos;s mine .
what is that ?
hold on .
what are you doing ?
what the ...
what the hell just happened ? don &apos;t worry , molly .
everything &apos;s gonna be all right .
_removed_
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s gonna leave .
this can &apos;t be happening .
well ...
trust me , it &apos;s happening .
well ...
okay .
thanks for helping , but i think i got it covered from here .
wait .
molly , molly , wait a minute .
just leave me alone .
no , no , no , please ! you have to listen ...
just stay away .
it wasn &apos;t a coincidence that we found you , all right ?
what are you talking about ?
we weren &apos;t cruising for chicks when we ran into you , sister .
we were already out here .
hunting .
hunting for what ?
ghosts .
d ... d ... don &apos;t ...
sugar coat it for her .
you &apos;re nuts .
really ?
about as nuts as a vanishing guy with his guts spilling out .
you know what you saw .
we think his name is jonah greeley .
he was a local farmer that died 15 years ago on this highway .
just stop .
one night a year , on the anniversary of his death , he haunts this road .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re here , molly .
to try and stop him .
now , i suppose this ghost made my car disappear , too .
crazier things have happened .
huh ?
you know what ?
i &apos;m all filled up on crazy .
i &apos;m gonna get the cops myself .
i don &apos;t mean to be harsh , but i don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna get too far .
what is that supposed to mean ?
means that plan &quot; a &quot; was trying to get you out of here .
obviously that didn &apos;t go over too well with , uh , farmer road kill .
molly , we &apos;re telling the truth .
greeley &apos;s not gonna let you leave this highway .
you &apos;re s ... you &apos;re serious about this , aren &apos;t you ?
deadly .
everyear , greeley finds someone to punish for what happened to him .
tonight that person is you .
why me ?
i didn &apos;t do anything .
doesn &apos;t matter .
some spirits only see what they want .
so you &apos;re saying this greeley , he took my husband ?
oh , god .
molly , look , we &apos;re gonna help , all right ?
but first , you got to help us .
help you ?
how ?
this is it . this is where i saw him .
must have been his hunting cabin .
seemed like a real sweet guy .
no markers or headstones outside .
you &apos;re looking for greeley &apos;s grave ?
yeah .
why ?
so we can dig up the corpse and salt and burn it .
oh .
sure . naturally .
it &apos;s a way to get rid of a spirit .
and that &apos;ll save david ?
this is what &apos;ll help both of you , provided there &apos;s a corpse to be found .
so how do we find it ?
uh , not sure .
after greeley died , his wife claimed the body .
and that was the last anyone saw of her .
so good guess she brought him back here .
but they have a thousand acres .
he could be buried anywhere on &apos; em .
is is really what you guys do .
you &apos;re like ghost busters .
yeah .
minus the jumpsuits .
this is a fascinating conversation and all .
but this highway is only haunted once a year , and we got till sun up to wrap this thing up .
what do you say we move it along , okay ?
great .
what are we looking for ?
greeley &apos;s house .
maybe he &apos;s buried there .
look for roads or paths or something .
stay close .
yeah .
okay .
_removed_
molly , help me .

hey !
are you all right ?
what has that son of a bitch done with my husband ?
just take it easy , all right ?
you &apos;re gonna see david again .
you will .
hey .
follow the creepy brick road .
go ahead .
that thing shoots rock salt ?
yep .
and plain salt keeps away spirits ?
simple remedies are always the best .
in most cultures , salt is a symbol of purity , so it repels impure and unnatural things .
same reason you throw it over your shoulder .
you know , just once i &apos;d like to round the corner and see a nice house .
any headstones outside ?
yeah , right .
is it ever that easy ?
i guess not .
you two check upstairs .
see if you can find any notes or records telling us where he &apos;s buried .
i &apos;ll just check down here .
great .
look at this .
it &apos;s greeley and his wife .
it &apos;s a love letter he wrote her .
my god , it &apos;s beautiful .
i don &apos;t understand how a guy like this can turn into that monster .
spirits like greeley are , uh ...
like wounded animals .
lost .
in so much pain , that they lash out .
why ?
why are they here ?
well , there &apos;s some part of them that ...
that &apos;s keeping them here .
like their remains or , um ...
unfinished business .
yeah .
it could be revenge .
could be love .
or hate .
whatever it is , they just hold on too tight .
can &apos;t let go .
so they &apos;re trapped .
caught in the same loops .
replaying the same tragedies over and over .
you sound almost sorry for them .
well , they weren &apos;t evil people , you know ?
a lot of them were good .
just ...
something happened to them .
something they couldn &apos;t control .
sammy &apos;s always getting a little j. love hewitt when it comes to things like this .
me , i don &apos;t like &apos; em .
and i sure as hell ain &apos;t making apologies for &apos; em .
there &apos;s nothing downstairs .
uh , just about every piece of mail or receipt they ever had .
looked through a couple , but nothing about a grave so far .
what ?
there &apos;s something behind here .
here .
it &apos;s locked from the inside .
smells like old lady in here .
and that would explain why .
well , now we know why nobody ever saw her again .
she didn &apos;t want to live without him .
dean , give me a hand .
really ?
what are you gonna do ?
we can &apos;t leave her like this .
why not ?
she deserves to be put to rest , dean .
so ...
so , if you manage to put greeley to rest , too ...
what happens to them ?
lady , that answer is way beyond our pay grade .
you hunt these things , but you don &apos;t know what happens to them ?
well , they never come back .
that &apos;s all that matters .
after they let go of whatever &apos;s keeping them here , they ...
they just go .
i hope someplace better , but we don &apos;t know .
no one does .
what happens when you burn their bones ?
well , my dad used to say that was like death for ghosts , you know ?
but ...
the truth is , we still don &apos;t know .
not for sure .
guess that &apos;s why we all hold on to life so hard .
even the dead .
we &apos;re all just scared of the unknown .
the only thing i &apos;m scared of is losing david .
i have to see him again .
i have to .
i think we should tell her about her husband . we can &apos;t .
dean , it &apos;s cruel , letting her pine for him like this .
i don &apos;t like keeping her in the dark .
it &apos;s for her own good .
i know you feel guilty , but let &apos;s just stick to the plan .
let &apos;s get her out of here . then we &apos;ll tell her .
tell me what ?
what aren &apos;t you telling me ?
it &apos;s about david . you know what happened to him .
molly sam , don &apos;t .
don &apos;t what ?
don &apos;t tell me because i &apos;ll mess up your hunt ?
you don &apos;t care about me or my husband .
that &apos;s not true .
really ?
then whatever it is , tell me , please .
he &apos;s coming .
stay with her ...
he &apos;s got molly !
this guy is persistent .
we got to find molly .
we got to find greeley &apos;s bones .
and , uh , no pressure or anything , but we got less than two hours before sunrise .
hey .
what do you got ?
&quot; february 6 , 1992 . &quot;
that was like two weeks before the accident , wasn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
it looks like the hunting cabin , but ...
i swear there &apos;s a tree there right where they &apos;re standing .
should have thought of it .
what ?
it &apos;s an old country custom , dean .
planting a tree as a grave marker .
you &apos;re like a walking encyclopedia of weirdness .
yeah . i know .
where &apos;s david ?
what did you do to him ?
you shouldn &apos;t worry about him anymore .
oh , my god .
you should worry about yourself .
i didn &apos;t do anything to you .
oh ?
i know ... i know about your wife .
hurting me won &apos;t bring her back .
my wife is gone .
all i got left &apos;shurting you .
p-please .
just let me go .
go ?
you &apos;re not gonna leave .
you &apos;re never gonna leave .
go get molly .
oh , thank god .
call me dean .
this guy &apos;s really pissing me off .
oh , baby , it &apos;s been a long night .
all right .
let &apos;s get you out of here .
i &apos;m not going anywhere until you tell me what happened to my husband .
_removed_
all this time i &apos;ve been looking for him , and you knew that ...
you knew that greeley killed him , didn &apos;t you ?
he &apos;s dead .
no , molly .
david &apos;s alive .
what ?
you &apos;re sure ?
i &apos;m sure .
we &apos;ll take you to him .
come on .
he &apos;s in that house right there .
i don &apos;t understand .
you will .
that &apos;s not ...
it can &apos;t be .
what &apos;s happening ?
who is that ?
that &apos;s david &apos;s wife .
i &apos;m sorry , molly .
15 years ago , you and your husband it jonah greeley with your car .
what are you saying ?
we &apos;re saying there isn &apos;t just one spirit haunting highway 41 .
there are two .
jonah greeley and you .
for the past 15 years , one night a year you &apos;ve been appearing on that highway .
no . that &apos;s not possible .
february 22nd ... 1992 .
yes .
molly , it &apos;s 2007 .
oh , god .
all right . tell me about highway 41 .
12 accidents over 15 years .
five of them fatal , all of them happening on the same night .
so what are we looking at ... interstate dead zone ?
phantom hitchhiker ?
what ? not quite .
year after year , witnesses said the same thing made &apos; em crash
a woman appearing in the middle of the road being chased by a man covered in blood .
two spooks ?
now , where is molly buried ?
she ... she wasn &apos;t buried anywhere .
she was cremated .
so much for burning her bones .
yeah , but then what &apos;s keeping her here ?
some spirits only see what they want .
_removed_
_removed_
stop !
stop !
_removed_
dean , i don &apos;t think she knows she &apos;s dead .
please !
open up !
please !
okay . all right , all right .
just calm down .
tell us what happened .
what are you gonna tell her ?
the truth .
she &apos;s gonna take off running in the other direction .
some spirits hold on too tight .
can &apos;t let go .
and greeley ?
each year he punishes somebody for his death ... chasing them .
torturing them .
and each year , that somebody is you .
but i don &apos;t remember any of it .
because you couldn &apos;t see the truth , molly .
so that &apos;s why he won &apos;t let me off the highway .
because ...
i killed him .
i killed us both .
why didn &apos;t you tell me when you first saw me ?
why wait until now ?
you wouldn &apos;t have believed us .
and you needed me for bait .
well , we needed you .
_removed_
molly , we brought you here so you could move on .
i have to tell him .
that you love him ?
that you &apos;re sorry ?
molly , he already knows that .
look , if you want to go in there , we &apos;re not gonna stop you .
yeah , but you are gonna freak him right out .
for life .
david &apos;s already said his good byes , molly .
now it &apos;s your turn .
this is your unfinished business .
what am i supposed to do ?
just ...
let go .
of david . of everything .
you do that ...
we think you &apos;ll move on .
but you don &apos;t know where .
no .
molly , you don &apos;t belong here .
haven &apos;t you suffered long enough ?
it &apos;s time .
it &apos;s time to go .
i guess she wasn &apos;t so bad ...
for a ghost .
you think she &apos;s really going to a better place ?
i hope so .
i guess we &apos;ll never know .
not until we take the plunge ourselves , huh ?
doesn &apos;t really matter , dean .
hope &apos;s kind of the whole point .
_removed_

you &apos;re now in the business of selling prepaid calling cards . immigrants especially , no offense .
they &apos;re always calling back home to whoever the fuck .
and it &apos;s expensive , right ?
you sell thousands of these cards to the greedy pricks , cards at a cut rate .

i had fucked up dreams last night .
fever dreams .
i shot this guy . he &apos;s a friend of mine .
now , in real life , this guy does do some things that annoy me .
like every christmas , he sends out these typed reports of what his nieces and nephews have been doing .
who got into west point , who got a hole in one .
and he hums ... tv commercials .
drives me fucking crazy .
but he &apos;s ... one of my best guys , a terrific earner .
so , what the fuck would i do that for ?
i was filled with-- anger .
yeah , right , anger , you know everything .
you have never dealt with your anger . and look at the cost .
you are the biggest threat to yourself .
that &apos;s what being a human being is .
but some people are more self- destructive than others .
you &apos;re gonna make me eat something now ? maybe .
if you keep this up .
i &apos;m dying .
i &apos;m gonna cover you with this blanket , okay ?
i don &apos;t want you to see me like this . please .

i know it was embarrassing for you , but ... anyway , if you ever wanted to talk-- this is who dad is .
my friends don &apos;t judge me .
and fuck them if they do , i &apos;ll cut them off .
that voice , that voice .
it &apos;s done , tony , over . my advice now is to put it behind you .
if this is all there is , these 23 tickets , they don &apos;t have &quot; bubkes &quot; and they know it .
i know it &apos;s a small thing , but that &apos;s the fucking point .
one more minute , if i could &apos;ve just stood there saying , &quot; yes , ma , okay , ma , i hear you , ma &quot; , one more minute , i wouldn &apos;t be in this spot .

my mother , my fucking goddamn idiot of a mother .
you &apos;d think she was never married to johnny soprano .
is there something else bothering you , anthony ?
that &apos;s not enough ?
fucking demented , old bat .
you &apos;re so angry with your mother and the airline tickets .
i &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s not serious , but a year ago your mother colluded to have you killed , yet you never say &quot; boo &quot; about that , even when i try to elicit .
if she tried to have you killed a year ago , believe me , in your childhood , she &apos;s inflicted serious psychic injuries that are still there .
poor me .
and your father , the gangster , tough guy .
did he protect you kids from borderline mother ?
what the hell was going on there ?
what is this ?
little snacks for thought for me to take home ?
i haven &apos;t pushed you enough to confront these things .
somewhere along the line , i became frightened of you .
maybe i should &apos;ve seen that clearer in the beginning .
rage , anthony , is a big , loud , flaming , self distraction from feelings that are even more frightening .
what feelings might those be ?
sadness .
you go off on a racist rant about indian food , your demented , old bat of a mother .
what else has happened ?
nothing .
after two years treating you , i &apos;ve learned things .
and i pick up sorrow coming from you .
i had a dream i fucked your brains out , right on that desk .
you loved it .
you threw that at me like a rock .
sadness , anthony , stay with that .
mommy tried to kill you and you gave her airline tickets .
fuck you . and now you &apos;re really in trouble .
i &apos;m gonna beat this shit , you kidding me ?

in fact , it was quite a big difference .
you have to understand , i was just crawling along , i had one day to live .
i was on my knees and i was hallucinating .
and then , those enormous doors opened up .
lots of horses kept galloping out and there wasn &apos;t death , there was ... driving those horses , it was the angels .
and i had this vision .
death didn &apos;t want me . death didn &apos;t really want me .
men are often haunted by things that happen to them in life , especially in war or other periods of great intensity .
sometimes , you see these men walking the streets or driving in a car .
their lives seem to be normal , but they are not .
when i &apos;m driving my car i often hear the voices of my dead friends .
sometimes , my friend duane martin calls me and tells me that his feet are cold .
because of this , even on a warm sunny day , i keep my convertible top up .
i was shot down over laos in 1966 , in the early phase of the vietnam war .
i never wanted to go to war .
i only got into this because i had one burning desire , and that was to fly .
but that there were people down there who suffered and who died only became clear to me much later ... when i was their prisoner .
this is dieter dengler .
he came to america 40 years ago , and for the last 15 years he has lived on mount tamalpais , north of san francisco .
yeah , this is a lot of fun .
you see , this really seems strange to most people , but to me it &apos;s very important .
it denotes freedom to be able to open or close a door .
when i was a prisoner , i couldn &apos;t open the door , and later on when i was dying those big doors in the sky would open up .
and so ... most people don &apos;t realize how important it is , and the privilege that we have to be able to open or close a door .
so ... anyway , that &apos;s a habit i got into and ... so be it !
well , this is the inside of my home .
but you see , when you come into my house right away there are pictures of open doors .
that &apos;s been always very important to me and ... it gives me a sense of freedom .
walk into my house , when i built this house 15 years ago
i focused on having this open feeling .
this was very important to me that i am on top of the mountain ,
i needed to find some kind of canyon .
well , looking out here you see a p-51 must ...
flying was always very important to me as a child
got little motors in there , don &apos;t know if they still work .
i can climb up there and see .
yes , they do .
anyway , again , just standing here you see that
i do have an open feeling in this house . there &apos;s a ... large stove .
i really enjoy to cook . food is very , very , very important to me .
as you see , there &apos;s a lot of food .
the refrigerator is always packed full with food .
the cupboard is full of food .
in fact , as i look in there it &apos;s half empty .
not only that , below the house
i have emergency provisions that i put in there years ago , that i &apos;m kind of hoarding down there .
well , i &apos;m really curious myself now to see if everything is still in good shape down here .
tear up this carpet here .
and those ... those five gallon containers .
yeah , everything seems to be ... still in good shape down here .
there is a 1000 pounds of rice .
there is a 1,200 pounds of flour and wheat .
there &apos;s 300 pounds of honey .
there &apos;s sugar down there .
i tell you , i &apos;ll probably never need ... any of this food , but i can sleep so much better knowing that it &apos;s down there .
well , while i was in prison ... all we did talk about was food .
we talked about deep freezers , and ... refrigerators , stacking &apos; em up and
i decided i &apos;m coming back home and i &apos;m gonna build a restaurant .
a german type restaurant and i &apos;m gonna stack it up and never be hungry again .
this is my mother .
she arrived in america after i had gained about 30 or 40 pounds .
i was in san diego , in a hospital .
she ... came on an airplane with ...
she turned the meal down , in the airplanes , because she thought it cost her a lot of money .
and , she was truly starved .
this is my father .
i only know my father from pictures .
he was killed in the war .
i miss not having a father .
it was just then later on ... when i was in vietnam and my friend duane &apos;s head was ... cut off and the vietcongs were all around me , there was just shooting and yelling , and ... yeah , i was just running along down this trail .
and then i came to this river fork and ...
here was my father , clear as a picture in the middle of the river standing and pointing with his arm , and just pointing and pointing ... for me , for the direction to go .
and i went behind the rocks and i worked my way up that riverbed .
i heard the vietcongs come by up the other side .
they went up the other side ,
and then later on , about five days later , i was rescued going up this other side .
so ... that was truly a miracle .
below me , you see my home town , wildberg .
i was born there .
my childhood years were ... spent right here .
down here you see the church and a few houses to the left , with my house .
it &apos;s not there anymore , the bombers came and ... and wiped out this town .
the first airplane ...
the first airplanes that i ever saw in my life , they came right over here .
they were fighters . they were ... they dove down onto this small town .
they mad senseless attacks on this small village just like this .
in behind me ... up there .
that &apos;s kind of how it looked .
i had two brothers then and we were out on the top window , and we looked out .
and we watched all this , and i clearly remember one of the airplanes ... came diving at our house , and it was so unusual because the cockpit was open .
the pilot had black goggles that were sitting on his forehead .
he was looking . he had actually turned around !
he was looking in the window .
and the machine guns were just firing , because the ... the flashes ...
i kept seeing them coming out .
and the left wing tip just missed the house by two or three feet . i seen it rip by !
_removed_
it was like an almighty being ...
that came out . it &apos;s just something else that &apos;s very difficult to describe .
but i knew from that moment on that i wanted to be a pilot .
i wanted to be a flier .
from that moment on little dieter needed to fly .
i have a few medals that i received .
that &apos;s an american fighter ace medal .
_removed_
distinguished flying cross , and the navy cross .
up here in the corner , this sword is called the sword of loyola .
it was blessed by the pope , it &apos;s brought over here by a bishop .
just two in existence .

what does it mean for you to be a war hero ?
oh , i &apos;m not a hero .
only people who are dead who are heroes .
and that &apos;s not a thing i want to be , and i don &apos;t think of myself as a hero .
no , only dead people are heroes .
if i start over here ...
this picture was sent to me recently by a friend .
this is the last shot of my airplane after i took ... when i took off for vietnam .
and this is how the airplane looked two hours later .
and this is dieter dengler , six months later , after his rescue .
he was down to 85 pounds .
i knew hunger as a child .
i grew up in post-war germany .
we lived in great poverty and i remember as children going to bombed out buildings , where we tore off wallpaper .
my mother would cook the wallpaper and we would eat it ... because there were nutrients in the glue .
as a child , dieter saw things around him that just made no earthly sense at all .
germany had been transformed into a dreamscape of the surreal .
and then , things got better .
dieter remembers the first sausage in a display window .
it was the first one in years , and he stopped and stared at it .
everyone else stopped too , but nobody could afford to buy it .
in post-war germany , there was no aviation .
and therefore , it remained dieter &apos;s dream to become a pilot .
this is a very , very , very old ... rare clock .
from age 14 , dengler apprenticed as a tool and dye maker .
he learned how to build church clocks .
not only did i learn to be a ... church clock builder ,
i learned to be a blacksmith .
god ! what a tough apprenticeship i had !
how many hours did i stand right here ?
how many times did i have that hammer on my side ?
i had this boss who was ... an old man .
he was a blacksmith , he had hands like that .
many times ... he would come up and hit me in the face .
i would be just ... i would be passing out .
we worked from seven in the morning till late at night .
including weekends . we made 50 cents a month .
it was truly horrible , but we stuck with it .
and then , later on in vietnam ...
that &apos;s the first time i recognized it .
what it meant really to me and without this tough , tough , tough man that beat us many , many times ;
i could have never made it .
he finished his apprenticeship at age 18 .
thirty minutes after his final exam dieter was already en route to america , because his dream of being a pilot had never died .
this photo was taken the moment he left .
i left from right down here for america .
i had 30 cents in my pocket ...
i was two hours out of town , i was hungry .
i had two weeks to wait for my ship to leave and i hitchhiked ... via hamburg , to bremerhaven where the boat left .
i was climbing up the ladder , i got seasick right away .
in the back of the ship they were playing a german national song :
i stepped on the ship and got seasick .
i was violently sick for 2 1 / 2 weeks .
but , i managed to go up in the kitchen or living room ...
not the living room , but where people were eating , and there i got sandwiches and i got oranges .
and i hoarded it all in my room .
and then , early in the morning there was an announcement that the statue of liberty was going to come in sight .
i went in my room . i took this large shirt from my grandfather .
_removed_
and i thought , we &apos;re just going to arrive , i &apos;ll walk off the ship .
but we had to go through customs . well , i never heard of customs .
i was this little 18 year old boy , i never was out of my hometown .
one time for one day we went to a castle somewhere .
we were extremely poor .
so , anyway i went through customs .
a lot of people were lined up . this customs agent came over .
the first thing , he grabbed my shirt .
pulled my shirt up and all the sandwiches and all those oranges fell on the floor .
i got beet red because when i left my hometown people were laughing , they said :
&quot; he &apos;s going to america . money &apos;s gonna ... he thinks money grows on the trees ! &quot;
they thought i &apos;m gonna end up in jail , and now i knew ... hey were right , i &apos;m gonna end up in jail .
i didn &apos;t speak any english , i knew a few words .
timmy square ... times square .
the highest house , two-story houses that i saw in germany .
here , i &apos;m in new york . manhattan .
walking around it was just a whole new world for me .
but again , of course i was extremely hungry .
so , i lived in the streets for about ten days and i met a couple people .
and then finally , i joined the air force .
because i really left germany to become a pilot .
and i couldn &apos;t do it in germany , germany didn &apos;t have an air force .
they didn &apos;t have an airline , they had no schooling whatsoever .
we had to work to help our parents just to survive and to live .
and so , i went to the recruiter in new jersey and he said :
&quot; of course ! if you join the air force you &apos;re going to be a pilot . &quot;
i signed up , two hours later i was in san antonio , texas . they cut my hair off .
but instead of becoming a pilot they put me in the kitchen .
there were 5000 recruits there .
7000 recruits ! i peeled potatoes for 2 1 / 2 years .
and then finally , i was put in the motor pool .
i changed tires but i never got near an airplane .
i went to night school . i became a citizen .
and then , i left for california because i knew by then what i had to do .
i had to go to college , get a college degree to join the navy .
and that &apos;s what i did . i bought a car , an old vw bus .
there was a big hole in the side .
i parked in the parking lot . i had my surfboard in there , my skis in there .
that &apos;s where i lived for 2 1 / 2 years .
worked at night , went to chool .
and after that i joined the navy .
and then , i was based in alameda .
and from there we left on the aircraft carrier for vietnam .
but from the air , vietnam didn &apos;t seem real at all .
for dengler it was like a grid on a map .
he had suddenly found himself not only a pilot , but a soldier caught up in a real war .
but even though it was all very real , everything down there seemed to be so alien and so abstract .
it all looked strange , like a distant , barbaric dream .
also , i ...
i flew the skyraider ... over vietnam , i had just left the carrier .
i had flown 2 1 / 2 hours through heavy flak .
i was coming near my target .
and i clearly remember my target was disappearing right at the wing root , where the wing meets the body .
and i rolled the airplane on its back
and then , of course i would see the target above me and i was coming straight down and just when i was inverted there was this loud explosion off the right side , half my wing was gone .
and i remember the brightness of it was just like a lightning striking .
the airplane then tumbled through the air .
i reached down and i dropped my tanks , and i thought i &apos;ll belly the airplane down in this valley .
but then , more explosions went off , off my right wing . boom ! boom !
the brightness is really what i remember .
i decided , maybe i can ... fly the airplane and glide it right over this ridge .
there was a ridge on the right hand side .
there was a lot of trees , as i said .
there was a ... an enormous tree in front of me and just before i hit it i kicked full right rudder .
the airplane yawed to the right .
there was an impact on the left wing .
it snapped this ... this , this thick tree off and of course then the left wing went back .
then the entire tail : the rudder , hose , stabilizer ...
everything just tumbled by .
i clearly the canopy started cracking , the lower left hand corner .
just like slow motion . it was cracked and it ripped off . then my helmet just jerked off my head .
and then the airplane started to cartwheel .
then i must have passed out because maybe a minute later i came back .
i was laying 100 feet from the airplane .
_removed_
you know , many times people ask me if i was afraid , if there was fear when i was shot down .
there really is no time .
i had to unstrap . i had to drop my fuel tanks .
i had to find ... i had to put the airplane in a small clearing .
it was extremely difficult to fly this airplane .
there was no time to have fear .
and then later on it &apos;s just like on an aircraft carrier .
3 : 00 in the morning , you &apos;re flying through this monsoon rain .
it &apos;s really not a rain , it &apos;s a waterfall that you &apos;re shooting through at 80 feet over the water ,
200 mph trying to find the aircraft carrier .
you have only contact through your headset with the operator on the ship .
it &apos;s total darkness .
then , finally there &apos;s this enormous bang as you hit the back of the aircraft carrier on your landing .
then , as you pull over to the side ...
as i turned my engine off ...
the engine would spin down .
spin down . then , my legs ...
that &apos;s the time when my legs start shaking . they would ...
_removed_
i would some time have to sit in cockpit for five minutes before i could crawl out .
and ironically ... later on , just before dying , there is no more fear .
it &apos;s like a dream .
it &apos;s just like floating along in a real thick medium .
i used to pinch myself , there was no more pain .
and i thought :
&quot; is this real ? is this unreal ? &quot;
this .
this is ... this is basically what death looks like to me .
two days after i was shot down , i was captured .
i did the unforgivable , i crossed a small clearing .
i came out of the thick jungle ...
i came to a small trail . i looked to the left , i looked to the right .
there was no one there .
i went to run across .
i was at about ten yards out of it and someone yelled : i turned to the right .
there &apos;s a guy standing there with a pistol , another guy was standing there with a rifle .
my hands shot in the air . i yelled in german : &quot; nicht schießen ! nicht schießen ! &quot;
right away i was surrounded by six other guys .
they stripped of my clothes , i was searched .
they took everything away .
they bandaged my left leg with bamboo because i hurt that in the crash .
and then we started to run .
we ran and ran . every so often i would collapse .
they would massage my leg . they would give me ... some water .
and then later in the evening with a rifle underneath a cluster of trees so the airplanes couldn &apos;t see us .
normally ... they took four pegs in the ground
i would have to lay on the ground .
_removed_
in his dreams , dengler would walk through an airport .
he was going to fly back home to the black forest .
but all the planes had been smashed to pieces .
yet , he knew that the pieces would start to move , and to reassemble themselves again into real planes .
as a broken coffee cup in the film &apos; play it backwards &apos; puts itself together and leaps back up on the table .
i was sure that my flight would be on time .
but then , the pieces of the plane didn &apos;t jump back together , as i had expected .
and i grew more and more horrified .
and i was glad when i finally woke up and found myself bitten by mosquitoes .
in the mornings i &apos;d wake up and a lot of times i couldn &apos;t even see because the mosquitoes had eaten , had stung and my face was all swollen up .
then we just walked , for days and days like that .
there were a lot of airplanes in the air . they were looking for me , my buddies .
and i need to make a signal . i need to have some kind of device to signal to them .
and luckily at one time i spotted a small survival mirror in the tobacco pouch of one of my guards .
i hung around these guards all the time , because sometimes we would walk ... late in the evening .
it was total dark . my hands were tied .
a guard would be in front of me . my hands would be tied , they would go over his shoulder .
here , i had the right guard in front of me and very carefully , ever so carefully ,
i opened his pocket and i took this box out ...
dengler succeeded in stealing the mirror , and for the first time he spent the night in a hut .
my legs and my ankles would be tied together with a rope .
_removed_
they would feed me up here .
then when the sleeping time came i would lay down . a guard would be on my right
a guard would be on my left .
there would be rifles there .
and that night i woke about 11 : 00-12 : 00 in the morning because it was bitter , bitter cold .
i knew that it was the right time .
i kicked my ... legs up two or three times really hard . the peg gave way .
i came up , i untied my legs slowly .
i came forward to the edge and very carefully i let myself down to the edge .
just when i hit the bottom , the pigs and the dogs and the chickens ran off .
there was a hell of a racket . i quickly went back up . i laid down again .
_removed_
they kept on snoring , nobody noticed .
i tried it one more time ... and then i was free .
_removed_
but my target was a mountain .
a coarse mountain just like that .
and that &apos;s what i was heading for .
i &apos;d seen that in the moonlight , but i didn &apos;t realize it was a coarse mountain .
there was crevices after crevice .
there was very , very sharp rock . it was very , very difficult to go up to this rock .
i finally got on top , there was no vegetation on top .
that day nothing came .
they had stopped looking for me .
not a single airplane . the only thing that really came was the sun . and it got hot .
i didn &apos;t count on that because i was for the last two weeks in the jungle .
it was cool down there , and i was already getting delirious and i was ...
i saw all those ... it was just terrible up there .
_removed_
i had saw ... seen a stinking waterhole at the bottom of this hill and that was my target , because i knew water was the only thing that would make me survive .
his guards knew where to find him .
the moment he started to drink the putrid water , they were all over him .
from then on , the torture began .
they would hang him upside down and put an ant nest over his face until he lost consciousness .
for several nights , they suspended him into a well shaft , in such a way that he almost died a slow death from drowning .
but he was worth more to them alive .
he was their prized possession .
and all of a sudden we came out of the jungle into an open area .
a real red-dusted area , there were about 30 guards standing there .
they had formed a circle .
i was dragged into the center of the circle and two north vietnamese guys were standing there .
they hard their caps on , the red stars on it .
they had khaki uniforms on .
they started yelling and screaming ... and start kicking me
and all of a sudden one of the guards came across the circle , walked towards me .
he had his rifle in his hand . the butt first .
_removed_
he swung towards me . i moved my head .
he hit me in the shoulder , knocked me down on my back .
the gun went off .
and i clearly remember looking across , another one of the guards closed his eyes , fell backwards over .
he had no shirt on , he had just a loincloth on .
i saw the blood coming out just above his kidneys .
his buddy saw that , he took his gun , started shooting at this guy who shot this guy .
i &apos;m laying on the ground . all of a sudden bullets are flying .
there &apos;s screaming and yelling . they had forgotten about me .
i thought it was the end of me . i closed my eyes .
i waited for ... i waited to be shot myself .
i closed my eyes . i looked over . i saw someone wrap a loincloth around this guy &apos;s waist .
you know , it was natural for them to be really angry at me now .
i had escaped from them , they had lost face , and they really wanted to get even .
whenever we were near the village , that &apos;s when they really became aggressive .
they had this new idea . my legs were tied up , my arms were tied up , my hands were tied up .
i was tied behind a water buffalo .
they &apos;d hit the water buffalo with a stick . he &apos;d start taking off .
i was hoping behind it . i was trying to keep my balance but pretty soon i fell over .
_removed_
they were kicking me in the face with the dust all the time .
they were kicking me-other guys would jump to my back .
the kids were laughing .
they thought it was just a lot of fun .
later on , they wanted me to sign something condemning the american aggression in vietnam .
i didn &apos;t sign it . i didn &apos;t believe in it .
they came up with this idea .
they stuck small , little ... pieces of bamboo underneath my fingernails .
they cut my arms .
_removed_
they cut here .
they cut here . at various different places .
then one guy had this idea , they &apos;d put this rope around my upper arm .
like a tourniquet , they put a piece of wood in there twisted and twisted it , until the nerves were cutting against the bone .
my hand would drop , and this hand was completely unusable for six months .
they were just always thinking of something to do to me .
it &apos;s christmas time in my home town in germany .
it &apos;s beautiful , all the decorations ...
it &apos;s like a christmas calendar .
but many , many years before , during the nazi time , it was a different story .
in fact , in this town , 100 % of the people voted for hitler .
except on person : my grandfather .
he was picked up at the house .
they hung signs around his neck saying that he was a traitor .
the parade on tinseltown .
there was a fanfare of drums and trumpets .
people spat out of the windows , water was poured on him .
and he feared for his life , he thought he was not going to live through it .
and for me , 30 years later when i was a pilot in vietnam .
i was a prisoner .
i was tortured and they wanted me to sign a piece of paper saying ... that i condemned the american action in vietnam .
and i was strong enough not to do that .
many times this strength came through my grandfather .
i was thinking of him ... and if he could do it , so could i do it .
oh oh . this feels a little bit too close to home .
of course , dieter knew it was only a film , but all the old terror returned as if it were real .
i thought : &quot; you guys behind me with your camera can only see my back , &quot;
&quot; but you can &apos;t know how my heart is thumping inside . &quot;
i told myself : &quot; okay , play along with them . &quot;
&quot; running like this might chase the demons away . &quot;
almost everything that i learned in survival school back at ... in california , i couldn &apos;t use in the jungle .
i watched my guards , they taught me a lot .
they taught me how to set traps . they taught me how to make fire .
in the jungle it &apos;s quite easy to find an old piece of bamboo .
which is right here .
you split it in half ...
and then you mount ... half in a vertical position .
you take four or five sticks and just ... to hold it into place .
then you take the other half ... and you need to cut a grove in the other one , from the top .
cut this grove just far enough in , so it just barely comes back on the other side .
then you take a machete ... or anything else , and you make some ... scrapings of the bamboo .
as you can see , it looks like a little wool .
now , i have prepared this a little bit already , but you take this wool ... and you put it over this crack , then you start rubbing .
okay .
being a prisoner , all of dengler &apos;s thoughts were focused on another escape , and on survival .
back in the mid-sixties , american strategic thinking was turned against russia .
so , all survival meant survival in russia and siberia .
a jungle war didn &apos;t factor much in their thinking .
and that &apos;s why their instructional films look somewhat funny .
you know , when it rained that hard you didn &apos;t have to collect water .
of course , our man immediately comes across heart of palm .
_removed_
very important is ... that you have got a knife .
of course , our man also has his whetstone on him .
and you better look hard for the enemy .
and now , the knife seems to be sharp as a razor .
you &apos;ve got to put it to the test .
a leaf should slice easily in two .
now , if the leaf doesn &apos;t cooperate , you can still chew it .
let &apos;s suppose you are wounded .
it &apos;s always smart to have your medicine kit on you .
you apply the right ointment .
rub it in , sleeve down , and done .
and it &apos;s a good idea to bring your radio transmitter along .
you make your position known to the planes above .
and then , you shoot a flare .
the rescue helicopter spot it , and you better scramble for a clearing .
the helicopter is already waiting .
but now , this is very odd .
what for god sake is our man signaling so frantically to the helicopter right above him ?
as we were walking through the jungle , we always had fire with us .
one of our guards had this little container on wires .
it was full of charcoal . he would swing it back and forth so it wouldn &apos;t go out .
some of the other guards would have a fan made out of bamboo .
they would cut it on top with a machete , then they would beat it flat with a rock .
they knew exactly what rind to cut , some white sap would come out .
it was really sticky , they would smear it all over the surface here .
and as we were walking along , they would just see a small or a big bug way up on a branch or a leaf .
they would reach up very carefully and the wings of this bug would stick on it .
they would take it off and they would lay it on top of this charcoal .
and it was-we were walking along , they were barbecuing all the time .
in fact , one time i turned around and they had a small bird barbecuing .
when we got there in the evening , they weren &apos;t hungry .
i was shot down over laos , and of course i was captured by the pathet lao .
we started walking towards the east , towards vietnam , and about 2 1 / 2 weeks later i was turned over to the vietcong .
even though later on i was kept in a pathet lao camp , it was clear to me that the north vietnamese were running the show .
they were a different breed of people , i was frightened of them .
they were very , very honest . they were very , very precise .
when i walked with them , we would come into a village ...
they would line up all the people . they would count the people .
they would write down the name of the village . they would look at their watches , it would be 7 : 28 .
they would know the time .
they would tie me down different at night .
there was no chance that i could escape .
in fact , there is one incident that &apos;s very vivid in my mind .
initially , when i was captured ... they took everything away from me ... except my engagement ring .
i insisted on keeping it and they let me have it .
and here , about 2 1 / 2 or 3 weeks later we arrived in this village .
we came to a hut , it just looked something like this .
there was a villager in the corner , he was cooking .
next thing , he &apos;s next to me .
he gave me a plate of rice . he smiled at me , he was very friendly .
all of a sudden he grabs over , he grabs my hand .
he gets a hold of my ring and he starts pulling my ring off .
and of course i &apos;m pulling back . and it &apos;s going back and forth , and back and forth like that .
there was no way this guy &apos;s gonna get my ring .
he got up , he left . i thought it was all over .
all of a sudden , a few seconds later , he &apos;s coming back with a machete .
he raises his arm .
i realized then i better let him have my ring .
the north vietnamese , they were in a corner .
they were doing something over there , they were not aware what was happening . they got up .
got our stuff together , and off we went , we left .
i was disappointed . i was unhappy .
and the longer we walked , the angrier i get .
and about 1 1 / 2 or 2 hours later i stopped them
i showed them my finger , it was all white where the ring had been .
at first they didn &apos;t understand what i was talking about .
i made stealing gestures .
they got together , they talked . then they turned around and started walking back towards this village . of course , i was happy .
i was thinking i &apos;m getting my ring back .
but i wasn &apos;t prepared for what happened next .
we got in this village ... next thing , they find this villager , they just beat the hell out of this guy .
and then , they grabbed this guy &apos;s hand .
violently they grabbed his hand .
they put it on top of the table , they put his finger there . they chopped his finger off !
i &apos;m leaping back ! the blood is squirting out !
the ... finger &apos;s laying on the ground .
the north vietnamese bends down , he picks up this finger .
he pulls off this ring , he sticks it on my finger .
i was speechless . i caused this misery , i felt horrible .
he nodded to me , we turned around , we walked off .
i realized right then and there , you just don &apos;t fool around with the vietcongs .
it &apos;s just a movie . don &apos;t worry about it .
and you still got your fingers and everything .
finally , after 3 1 / 2 weeks i arrived at a prison camp .
i looked forward to coming to the camp .
i had been beaten so much . i lost so much blood .
i had been unconscious so many times .
i wanted to share my misery with someone else .
other pilots . i was hoping to see someone , maybe meet someone i have known before .
maybe a doctor would be there , but it was totally different than what i expected .
first of all , i thought i was all alone in this ... this camp .
high bamboo walls on the side .
the huts were built out of grass and out of bamboo .
i was let in , they threw me into one of the huts .
and only three hours later they opened the door and let the other guys come out .
i couldn &apos;t believe my eyes , the first guy was carrying his intestines around in his hand .
there was six of them .
there were 4 thais , 2 americans ...
duane martin who became my friend later on .
the next guy came out , he had no teeth .
with a rusty nail and a rock they would knock each other &apos;s teeth in ... to let the puss out .
they &apos;d been there 2 1 / 2 years . it was just awful .
i looked at them and i realized that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m gonna look in six months .
_removed_
we needed the water to drink .
at nights we would be handcuffed .
sometimes we would get cross-handcuffed , sometimes straight-handcuffed .
cross-handcuffed , this is a more modern handcuff , would be like that .
left wrist would go to the right wrist of the guy on my right .
my right wrist would go to the left wrist of the guy on my left .
this way we &apos;d be together .
_removed_
twenty times a night , this guy made the motion , this guy had to make the motion .
on top of it , our legs were in foot blocks , big wooden blocks they made .
our feet would be driven through there , a pin would come in between .
some sides were be longer , sometimes it would be shorter .
and this is the way they expected you to sleep .
if you had no blankets it was miserable cold .
in the misery of those nights ,
dengler often dreamt of oceans and foreign shores .
and i dreamt that a boat appeared .
and the whole american navy came to rescue me .
and i waved . and i shouted .
but they wouldn &apos;t listen .
they just kept on going and went somewhere else .
as far as food , they themselves were very poor .
at the beginning we were given a handful of rice , then later on a ...
a handful of rice for all of us .
sometimes they would catch a deer .
they would cut a deer open , they would take the grass out from the inside .
that &apos;s what we would get to eat .
they would keep the meat . they would take the meat and stuff it in a bamboo container .
after 4 or 5 days it would rot so bad for themselves . they would come in with a towel
they would pour it out , it would be white , it was covered smack , and it would stink to high heaven .
first time i tried it i vomited . but if you didn &apos;t eat it , you just died .
we were luck , though , because we couldn &apos;t go to the bathroom .
so , once every 3 or 4 weeks they would let us out .
we would go to the bathroom right below us , it would stink to high heaven .
i mean it was awful , but there were rats down there .
and we couldn &apos;t catch the rats , but there was a snake there .
and every so often we were lucky to catch that snake .
we would look , we would lay on our bellies , we watched this snake line up on the rat .
get a hold of the rat .
we had a stick , we would get the snake , we pulled the snake up , we pulled the rat out .
we cut the rat apart and everybody got his share .
we lost , of course , a lot of weight waiting for the rain to come .
but ... we had to supplement our food for the day that we left for freedom .
well , initially ... initially , february or march ... we were allowed to go to the bathroom in the morning ... for about two minutes .
and ... we had ...
we have a couple of tubes you go in at night and you can imagine you &apos;re in a big block in the woods , and you &apos;re handcuffed like that and you got to go to the bathroom at night
with a guy having diarrhea or dysentery .
so , it was a real mess , but while we walked down , we run down like hell .
there &apos;s about a 20 or 30 foot walk to the hole .
and while we did this they ... they shot at us .
and it got so close that some of the prisoners came back with black in the face , or greased their hair with a bullet , and ...
so , we didn &apos;t even want to go anymore . we ... we rather stayed with the tubes .
the question is : &quot; why were they shooting at ya ? &quot;
just harassment .
they will take a gun and they &apos;d show it to you , they put a ... a round in it and they put it right onto your head and they ... take the safety off and they go :
_removed_
so ... i &apos;m lucky to be here !
the camp was inside laos , and the shortest way out would have been east to the ocean .
but there were impassable mountains and , of course , north vietnam .
what made most sense for them was to go west .
to float down the river to the mekong , and then cross to freedom in thailand .
our plan to escape from this prison camp was planned right down to the last detail .
we had six months , we &apos;re waiting for the monsoon rain .
we had a little problem amongst ourselves .
some of the prisoners didn &apos;t want to escape .
in 1966 there was really no war in laos .
they were hoping to be released pretty soon , and also they were afraid to be shot on the way out .
this changed pretty dramatically , real quick , because the thais , who spoke the language , in this hut overheard the guards outside talking about that they would take us in the jungle , shoot us so it would look like we &apos;d escaped
because they wanted to go home anyway , because they had hardly anything else to eat .
of course , now we all thought alike .
and we had to move really , really quick .
and the plan was that if i would make it out of my hut ... into this hut over here , without being seen , the other guys would follow me .
now , we had ... for the last 2 or 3 weeks , we had a little diagram .
we had little squares with names on it for the people and the rifles .
we would look through the cracks . we would observe them . we would listen to them .
and pretty soon we knew exactly where every rifle was , where every person was , because this was very , very important .
that they would all be in the kitchen at the same time , because our plan was that while they were in the kitchen we would encircle them .
we would capture them .
lock &apos; em up . hold the camp
signal the airplanes at night and be rescued right out of there .
now , during the day there was only one time that we could do this .
we had about two minutes , 120 seconds to do this .
_removed_
food time ! &quot;
only then would the guards leave their rifles behind .
the next problem was to get out of the handcuffs .
it &apos;s quite simple . nowadays everybody ought to know how to open a handcuff .
if you come a little closer with your camera i can show you how to do that .
with this small key , i &apos;m gonna open the handcuff to show you the functions inside .
as you look in there , you see this small spring going back and forth .
you &apos;ll also see a few teeth in there that holds the handcuff in place .
now , just with a regular paperclip ... you can open this handcuff quite simply by inserting ... one of these ends into the opening .
apply pressure to the spring , pulling the handcuff open .
the day came .
the cook yelled : &quot; chow time ! &quot;
i stripped my blocks , i let myself to the floor .
i was underneath my hut now . i crawled quickly over to the logs , those heavy logs that i had to lift out .
_removed_
my heart was really pounding . i crawled across . i came to this fence .
i untied the rattan . slipped the bamboo up and rushed through this door and i leaped into this hut .
there were three rifles in there , two i passed away , and the other one i kept .
i ran out into the open . nobody came out from this side except the guards running in my direction .
they must have heard or seen the other guys .
this big shootout started .
all of a sudden the bullets were flying . somehow we had miscalculated .
somebody had a rifle in there .
i had this sub-machine gun in my hand . i never shot one before .
when i pulled the trigger it practically flew out of my hand .
it raised up like that and this allowed them to close this distance real quick .
they came within 2 or 3 feet from me .
the moron , one of the guys , had a machete in his hand .
he came within 4 or 5 feet , i shot him through the hip .
it lifted him up , it threw him down to the ground .
next thing i &apos;m looking up , he &apos;s getting up again .
he still had the machete , he &apos;s still coming at me . of course this time i couldn &apos;t miss he was right 2 or 3 feet in front of me .
i couldn &apos;t believe it .
i didn &apos;t have a scratch . there was five dead guards laying on the ground .
two of them got away .
they ran a zigzag pattern and they got in the jungle .
i knew then , right then and there , they would get help ... and we had to get out of there .
where was duane ? i saw him behind this bush over here , he had vomited .
i yelled to him : &quot; duane , let &apos;s get out of here ! let &apos;s get out of here ! &quot;
we took off . we ran down between this kitchen . we run ... ran amongst those dead guys laying on the ground .
and it was very important because our shoes were tied together in a bundle , were hanging on this hut over here .
the shoes we needed in the jungle but when we got there .
they were already taken . the other guys must have taken them and run off with them .
and then , duane and i , we had no choice but to turn around , barefoot we ran into the jungle .
of the seven of us that escaped , i was the only one that came out alive .
the other ones disappeared in the jungle and nobody ever heard from them again .
god ! how did i ever make it through this jungle , barefoot , for weeks .
i &apos;ll never know .
dieter and duane were struggling to make their way through the jungle .
weak and starved , their feet badly cut by thorns .
after ten days they reached a river , somewhat like this one .
only the river was much higher because of the monsoon rains .
we were ecstatic . we felt like dancing and we thought that this was our highway to freedom .
exhausted as they were , they managed to build a small raft and climbed aboard .
there we were on this river , this beautiful river , drifting down between hills and mountains for a couple- hour and a half , down towards thailand .
i thought i heard something . i said :
&quot; duane , do you hear anything ? &quot;
but then it got quiet again , but when we came a ... around the next hill , we heard it at the same time .
we both yelled : &quot; waterfalls ! &quot; he leaped off .
i jumped in the water . i was actually in the water , i grabbed the rifles .
i kicked as hard as i could .
i was taken off . i was going then towards ... this side .
duane was already nearly over there , but i had these rifles in my arm and i couldn &apos;t really swim that fast .
_removed_
and i thought i wouldn &apos;t make it and finally there was a couple of rocks sticking out .
i clung on this rock and i looked over the side and ... our raft had tumbled and tumbled and tumbled down 300 feet .
it disintegrated on the bottom .
i was speechless . i looked at duane , he was snow-white .
we had just ... escaped death i mean it was truly touch and go .
we were speechless .
we just sat there after i made it to shore . trying to decide what to do .
one of the rifles , we threw away .
it was vertical going down , on both sides .
we had a very difficult , because it was full of green moss .
full of green mud during the rainy season .
the ground was very muddy and on the vines we were sliding down , helping each other down .
and late in the evening we arrived on the bottom .
we were totally exhausted . we were totally disillusioned .
then barefoot , over rocks and sticks we ...
down the river we went , looking forward towards freedom .
to this day , i often think about duane martin .
we shared so many hardships , hopes and despair .
and this made us grow very close .
by the end , duane was closer to me than anyone else in my life .
even closer than my mother and my brothers .
behind me is the mekong .
we called it &quot; the big muddy &quot; .
over there is laos . i was a prisoner of war over here .
over here is thailand . freedom .
we talked about this river so many times .
we dreamt about this river . this river was our target .
but we never reached it .
when i think about it now , even though it &apos;s over 30 years ago , it &apos;s just like it happened yesterday .
i remember , duane and i , we had ... nearly starved to death when we escaped the camp .
we were barefoot in the jungle within the first mile our feet were cut to shreds .
in fact , they swelled up to big white stumps .
we had found a single sole of a tennis shoe .
and we alternated wearing it , and we would tie it to one of our foot with rattan .
and then came the monsoon .
the monsoon is something else .
i mean , you have to really be there to ... to know what i &apos;m talking about .
it &apos;s just deafening . you can scream on top of your lungs and nobody can hear you .
the water comes down like somebody turned on ... a bathtub .
it goes for hours , for days .
the mud ! the bamboo !
all the stuff the comes down from the mountains .
in fact , duane and i , we had to look for high grounds .
we tie ourselves down to a stump or trees .
not to be swept down with this mud overnight . of course , we would hug each other .
we needed each other for warmth .
we needed each other for friendship in this misery .
and then came dawn . i would look over there and i couldn &apos;t even recognize duane .
duane would be covered from top to bottom with mud and blood .
i looked the same .
we had leeches , not 20 , not 50 .
_removed_
it was like a belt . it was black around there . our legs were covered with leeches .
they were looking for the soft spots .
between our fingers , underneath the arms , and the nose and the ears .
it was awful .
they &apos;re tiny , tiny creatures . like a needle , they find ever tiny , little hole .
they attach themselves , they suck themselves full with blood , as big as this finger .
we would then take our rags off , we would take bamboo and we scraped them off , and on we went .
but then , there were a couple of times we thought we really had it made .
one time , we built a raft . we had to abandon the raft .
the raft went over the waterfall . but then , later on we made this beautiful fire .
we waved at night to the airplanes . they saw us , they circled overhead .
and we knew , we &apos;re gonna be rescued , that next morning .
we were elated . we hugged each other , we cried together .
we talked about who &apos;s going in the helicopter first .
what are we gonna eat .
who are we gonna call .
and then morning came , and we waited and waited , and nothing happened .
it was a blow . what a disappointment .
but then we had to move on because we were starving to death .
in fact , we couldn &apos;t even walk anymore .
we were crawling and lay on our knees around this small little trail .
and all of a sudden there was this small boy on our left .
he was carrying a water container over his shoulder .
and all of a sudden , there was all this commotion . people were running ... all over each way . there was noise .
duane and i right away were on our knees and we put our hands together .
we said : &quot; hello . sabai . &quot;
duane then starts sitting back and started getting up .
and all of a sudden out of the corner of my eye i saw something .
i looked over there , a villager was standing there . he had a machete in his hand , high above his head .
he just hesitated for a second and then he swung .
he swung for me , i ducked , it missed me by a few inches .
he hit duane in the upper leg , the blade was deeply buried .
and then duane screamed . he reached down , he grabbed his leg , screaming !
and with the next swipe ... duane &apos;s head came off .
blood squirting out ! i start screaming .
i leaped towards this villager . he turned around , he ran . in fact , they all started running
and unknown to me , i had reached down and grabbed this rubber sole from his foot .
i turned around and ran , where thirty seconds before i was crawling along .
duane , my friend , he was gone .
and from then on , my motions , my progress , became mechanical .
in fact , i couldn &apos;t care less if i would live or die .
but then later on , there was this bear .
this beautiful bear that was following me .
it was circling me . in fact , sometimes when it was gone , i missed it .
it was just like a dog . it was just like a pet .
of course , i knew , this bear was there , he was waiting to eat me .
when i think about it ... this bear meant death to me .
and it is really ironic ...
that the only friend i had in the end was death .
how dieter dengler has been able to cope with all this remains a mystery .
he hides behind the casual remark that this was the fun part of his life .
dieter took an early retirement from the armed forces and became a civilian test pilot .
he survived four more crashes , and flies to this day .
death did not want him .
- what &apos;s that , about 20 pounds ?
- no , 30 actually . -30 pounds .
my god , he &apos;ll be surprised .
how long did it take to cook that thing ?
- a good five hours . - five hours .
dieter !
god , my suspicions were true !
- it &apos;s good to see you !
- happy thanksgiving , friend !
this is eugene deatrick , to whom dieter dengler ultimately owes his life .
dieter wanted to surprise him on thanksgiving .
i wouldn &apos;t be here without you and i really appreciate what you did for me .
- and that you followed it up and ... - sit down , tell me all about it .
my god ! you &apos;re losing hair .
both of them . tell me did you have any suspicion , even a little bit ?
i had a little bit .
you don &apos;t come down here for ... no one telling you what it is , but by god it &apos;s good to see you .
all right , i haven &apos;t done that too many times , but ...
what a turkey .
_removed_
andy and i started to take off that morning .
i have said many times to people that this was a million in one shot .
if everything hadn &apos;t gone exactly right we never would have found you .
just step by step .
we were late getting off .
supposed to leave at eight .
didn &apos;t get off until about noon or 1 : 00 .
we came up and it was an armed wrecking area .
which meant that you could bomb anything in the area if you thought it was enemy .
and i left andy high , to stay in contact with danang .
and i went down on the deck .
and i saw this big boy river coming out of the mountain .
and i thought i &apos;ll go up that as a first shot .
and again , if it hadn &apos;t been that you were right in the bend , because as you fly straight i couldn &apos;t see down .
but just where you were there was a bend in the river .
i made that 90 degree bank and - looked down and there on that rock ...
- a split second ! and this nut sitting down there waving at me .
and i thought that was nice and flew on .
i must have gone 5 or 10 minutes and i &apos;ll never know whatever made me come back .
but something just didn &apos;t settle right , that ...
i guess you , it wasn &apos;t a conscious effort , but ...
natives don &apos;t ...
- hang on and wave to you . - wave to me on a fully loaded airplane .
so , i came back and when you were there a second time waving ...
i really wasn &apos;t sure what it was ...
you know that piece of white material , you know where it came from ?
- the flare . - the flare .
actually , it wasn &apos;t the flare .
about five days before ...
you know , i had gone down to a village , and the americans saw it and dropped flares , and it was one of those parachutes .
and i had already given up ... it looked like fishing nets from where i was .
well i &apos;ll tell ya . i pulled that sucker down and i had that thing in my little backpack
and when i heard an airplane i didn &apos;t even look up .
all i could do is reach back there . that &apos;s when i pulled that white piece of material out .
i was thinking : &quot; sos . sos . &quot;
&quot; how does it go , does the s go this way ?
or the s go this way ? &quot; and i ripped my pants off , trying to lay it down .
and every so often i would look up and you were way in the corner between the clouds .
i thought : &quot; oh god . please don &apos;t let him leave . please don &apos;t let him leave . &quot;
- i was laying out this sos ...
- and as i came back around the next time
i asked andy if he could see anything , and that &apos;s when he saw the parachute and said : &quot; it looks like he has an sos . &quot; well that ... gave us both the clue that ... someone was down there , and the fact that you were there after three passes ...
so , we pulled off to the side and i called the crown aircraft , which is the
c-121 controller in that area .
and i asked them if anyone had been shot down .
they said there was no air force , no navy , no marine , no laotians , no thai .

but we finally got approval and they got the rescue helicopters , two of them .
and the aircraft on the coast escorted them in . i took the lead helicopter when they got in sight .
put him down and told him where you were , and went out .
and that &apos;s when he dropped his long range tank up the river from you .
that &apos;s the first time i realized it was for real .
because you know , i was hallucinating all this time
and when i smelled that gasoline i knew it was for real .
and ... he couldn &apos;t get down very low because of the mountain .
and he dropped the penetrator cable down and i saw you climbing aboard .
and it was then that my heart began to beat , i &apos;ll tell you .
well you know , i couldn &apos;t even pull down the zip on the penetrator .
i had it in my armpit as i was going up .
the helicopter had come in and all the trees and the bushes
blowing me around down there and i had a hard time catching that .
as i was going up i was just going around and around .
they were taking off because the vietcongs , they were shooting up at them .
the guys up there had the machine guns , not only on them but also on me , because they thought that i might be a vietcong .
they probably had the same idea i had .
not recognizing dieter as an american , and fearing he might be a vietcong on a suicide mission , a black corporal on board the helicopter threw his weight of 300 pounds upon the skeleton that was left of dieter , and wrestled him to the floor .
the previous day dieter had seen a snake swimming in the water , and had bitten it in two from hunger .
searching for explosives , the corporal pulled out half a snake from under dieter &apos;s shirt .
it gave him such a shock that he fell halfway out of the helicopter , and had to be rescued himself .
so , as he started to pull away and i saw you going in , and the thing didn &apos;t blow up ,
i gave a great sigh of relief , i &apos;ll tell you that !
that scared me . i thought my career would be over if that ...
and as they went away i asked &apos; em if they could identify you .
and they said that they didn &apos;t know who it was but he claimed that he was a navy lieutenant that had been shot down several months before .
and i &apos;ll tell you , my heart gave a sigh of relief .
dieter wanted to be back with the fleet , back on his ship .
he had been taken to the hospital in danang .
he was safe now , but he was sure this was only a dream .
for him , this was just a mirage .
he wanted to run , and they had to tie him to his bed .
so , his friends came and snuck him out and brought him back to the carrier .
the elevator took him down to the hanger bay .
it was a drizzly day , and there had been hardly anyone on deck .
but there was something strange , something almost eerie about the fact that no one was there .
unknown to myself , the admiral had assembled about ... 4000 people up here in the hanger bay .
they were waiting for me and i was thinking that nobody would know that i was alive
that this was going to be a total surprise .
so , the airplane was ... the engine was turned off .
the airplane was pulled in here .
we came over here . there was just a ... load of these people .
4000 guys were waiting . they opened ... the door , there was a red carpet .
and the yelling and the screaming started .
it was such an emotional moment . i just can &apos;t really describe it .
the tears ! all my friends that i &apos;d been through flight training with . norman , spook ...
farcas , lizard . they all were there .
tears were rolling ... hugging .
and finally , i was on the aircraft carrier , they were all my buddies .
the other pilots there , they did everything they could for me .
it was just unreal . the admiral packed his bag .
he left . he said : &quot; dieter , my quarters are your quarters . &quot; i slept in his bed .
at nights i would have dreams , i would yell and scream .
my friends would tie me down , they even got afraid of me sometimes .
so , they finally figured it out and they would take me up in a cockpit .
at nights they would take me up on top of the carrier deck and they would pack me into a cockpit , put two or three pillows next to me .
that &apos;s where i felt safe . that &apos;s where i felt ... truly , truly safe .
and then i would sleep in there .
in fact , later on when i was on different bases , sometimes at nights i would come down and i would go to an aircraft cockpit , and i would just bed in there and i would sleep in there .
and i brought you here to show you all these airplanes .
i mean , this is a heaven for pilots . i mean , just look around .
in every directions there &apos;s just miles , and miles and miles of airplanes . everywhere !
here , miles and miles ...
god ! look at the cockpits !
these are just fantastic !
these are just really , really , truly beautiful .
and one could really feel at home here .
this is just a heaven for a pilot .

previously on &quot; alias &quot; ...
neil caplan .
he &apos;s a mathematician out of caltech .
the bureau confirmed he and his family were kidnapped from the long beach aquarium yesterday .
if you want me to help you , you let my family go .
all i need to know now is whether you want to come with me .
yes .
i didn &apos;t have a clean shot .
and i took it anyway .
i &apos;m putting in for reassignment to the directorate of intelligence .
if i had the shot , i might have taken it .
i know what emily meant to you .
i &apos;m sorry .
arvin ?
arvin ?
this plan might not hold up .
the cia knows too much .
they could guess why we were after the genetic database .
i &apos;m not interested in the database .
i want satellite footage of tuscany .
i want to know who murdered my wife .
we both had to make sacrifices , arvin .
you won &apos;t forgive yourself if you stop now .
we &apos;re so close to knowing what rambaldi knew .
i wish i never heard that man &apos;s name .
good news , relatively speaking .
using the administrative codes we acquired at brucker ,
i was able to download a copy of the database .
but it &apos;s still encrypted ? yes .
although neil caplan &apos;s still analyzing the remainder of the rambaldi text , his background should allow him to crack the algorithms .
i don &apos;t understand how we don &apos;t have a single lead on sloane or mom .
there &apos;s a difference between intelligence and actionable intelligence .
what about the earrings mom left me ?
analysis couldn &apos;t trace the source .
marshall &apos;s trying to figure out how they receive anything .
we have to get ahead of them .
we know they &apos;re acquiring rambaldi artifacts .
we know they tried to access a dna database .
there must be some way to predict what they &apos;re gonna do .
i understand your frustration in light of emily &apos;s death .
but sometimes there isn &apos;t a clear move to make .
look at this .
elsa caplan &apos;s debrief transcript .
it &apos;s barely 10 pages long .
sloane kidnapped her husband 2 months ago .
all we have are 10 pages ?
if you feel elsa caplan was improperly debriefed , do it again yourself .
how &apos;s your son ?
he &apos;s keeping me sane .
even with the security detail , it &apos;s hard to feel safe .
i don &apos;t want to make this more difficult for you .
but i need a little more of your help .
i &apos;d like to bring you in for a regression-therapy session .
it &apos;s like hypnosis .
it &apos;s completely safe . i &apos;ve done it myself .
no offense , but i don &apos;t feel comfortable with the government poking around in my head .
_removed_
we &apos;re out of leads .
what are you saying ?
that if something happens to him , it &apos;s my fault ?
of course not .
these people threatened to kill my son .
- he &apos;s still having nightmares .
- wait .
you come and tell me i &apos;m not doing enough ?
- that &apos;s not what i meant .
- aaron , come on .
it &apos;s time to go .
how dare you .
sweetie , honey , it &apos;s time to go .
we still need your help .
i &apos;ve just downloaded this .
it &apos;s a catalog of over 10 million people &apos;s dna .
we &apos;re looking for someone specific . a man .
but it &apos;s encrypted .
we need you to break it .
for the past two months ,
i haven &apos;t heard a word about my family or been given any indication whether they &apos;re dead or alive , so ... you can just kill me .
just kill me , &apos; cause there &apos;s no way
i &apos;m gonna help you anymore .
what if i told you that your family &apos;s not only alive , but we let them go ?
call your house .
call .
elsa !
it &apos;s me .
elsa !
elsa , i &apos;m alive .
she can &apos;t hear you .
i &apos;ve modified the cellphone .
they &apos;re home .
they &apos;re safe .
now you have something to live for , mr. caplan .
elsa caplan was living under protective custody for two months .
i was so convinced that we were overlooking something that i went there and implied that she wasn &apos;t doing enough to save her husband .
how stupid .
no one &apos;s harder on themselves than you are .
vaughn , i mean , okay .
the backpack is getting ridiculous .
what do you mean ?
the middle drawer ... it &apos;s yours .
it &apos;s just a drawer .
i &apos;m just saying it &apos;s a great idea .
you sure ?
i love my drawer .
if we &apos;re gonna keep working , i need to make a sandwich .
there were three calls made from the same number to caplan &apos;s house over the last year .
they came exactly four months apart .
they were all made on a monday night at the same time .
and they all lasted one minute .
where did the calls come from ?
i need to talk to you .
is it neil ?
before neil &apos;s abduction , three calls were made to your house over the last year at odd hours .
we traced the number to a reporter named gregory ivanov .
does that name mean anything to you ?
no .
we ran a background check .
he was a journalist out of los angeles for itar-tass , a news service known for giving cover to russian intelligence agents .
this man , ivanov ... we think he &apos;s one of them .
we put ivanov under electronic surveillance .
an hour ago , he received a fax from an unknown source .
i don &apos;t understand .
your husband may have been working for the russian s vr .
it &apos;s their equivalent to the cia .
what did the fax say ?
a single russian word ...
it means &quot; endgame . &quot;
neil &apos;s gonna die .
- elsa , we don &apos;t know that . - no .
i do .
not you ?
i didn &apos;t want to be hypnotized because i was afraid you &apos;d find out .
ivanov was my handler .
seven years ago , i was ordered to seduce and marry neil .
my objective was to keep tabs on his work .
i was given a tracking device to implant in his arm .
but it has a secondary purpose .
it was designed to release 50 milligrams of cyanide into his bloodstream .
it &apos;s a suicide pill .
that &apos;s what the fax was about .
it means it &apos;s been activated .
you &apos;re not authorized to be telling me this ?
i &apos;ve just committed treason against my government because i want to get him back .
i &apos;m telling you because i love him .
i have a lead on sloane and irina .
- we have to move immediately .
- vaughn briefed me .
elsa caplan shouldn &apos;t be processed as a walk-in .
she &apos;s an s vr agent .
which means we can classify her as a defector .
or we can arrest her and try her for espionage .
until we make that determination , i &apos;m holding her .
she wants to help .
she implanted a tracking chip in her husband .
the chip &apos;s activated by a code .
if we get a locating device , we can enter the code , find him , and remove the device before it releases the cyanide .
i &apos;ve asked marshall to look into the possibility of reverse-engineering a locator .
it &apos;ll take him three days .
caplan will be dead by then .
the chip &apos;s set to release cyanide in 42 hours .
there &apos;s a black-market contact who deals in s vr contraband .
i &apos;m going to meet him .
i &apos;m not willing to risk your life based on speculative intel you acquired from a russian spy .
- why would she lie ?
- that &apos;s the question .
- she turned herself in .
- she &apos;s not the first .
i realize we &apos;re talking about a russian agent who betrayed her husband , but elsa caplan and my mother are not the same person .
elsa &apos;s first instinct , her first thought , was for her husband &apos;s life .
that &apos;s your assessment .
if we find neil caplan , we find sloane and derevko .
isn &apos;t that worth the risk ?
we &apos;ll move on elsa &apos;s statement only if we can corroborate it .
when did you start playing it safe ?
you let derevko walk out of here because you thought she could lead us to sloane .
a mistake i &apos;m not anxious to repeat .
and if neil caplan dies ?
then he dies .
who has my son ?
- he &apos;s being taken care of .
- i thought you believed me .
- i do believe you .
- why am i in this cell ?
i risked everything , committed treason against my own government .
it &apos;s not that simple . there are protocols to follow .
this is director bristow .
i want solitary confinement imposed on elsa caplan .
no unapproved visitors . understood ?
we still have 42 hours .
we &apos;re doing everything we can ...
elsa , don &apos;t react .
you &apos;re listening to a recorded message being transmitted through a directional sound projector .
you &apos;re the only one who can hear this .
the cia won &apos;t sanction a team to get the locator .
i &apos;m going in myself .
i know none of this is much of a consolation to you ...
i need you to give me the locator codes .
cross your arms and tap them out in morse code .
back away from the glass , please .
i have authorization .
back up now .
thank you .
it &apos;s been 24 hours .
this database is encoded with an 8192-bit military-grade polymorphic encryption .
now , unless you want to kidnap a smarter genius , it &apos;s gonna be a little while .
tell me what you need to speed this up .
i need access to a cray supercomputer .
i hope you &apos;re not stalling , mr. caplan .
because your safe return to your family is no guarantee .
understand ?
- a few days ago ...
- oh , my leg !
i would have done anything to keep you alive .
my leg ...
and now ... i don &apos;t care .
arvin .
arvin , don &apos;t .
we still need him .
my leg .
where would you be transferred to ?
i &apos;ll be reassigned within the agency , maybe to texas or d.c .
i &apos;d be an analyst .
i would be safe .
you &apos;d be happy not being in the field ?
i &apos;d be happy .
as long as you and the kids are with me .
sloane &apos;s the man who ran sd-6 .
the one who lied to you for years .
marcus .
you are not responsible for what happened to his wife .
he put her in harm &apos;s way .
that &apos;s not the only reason i &apos;m putting in for the transfer .
i &apos;m doing it for us .
when you first told me the truth ,
i said i didn &apos;t know who you were .
i was wrong .
i just didn &apos;t know what you did .
i have always known who you are .
you are the most decent man i know .
whatever you decide ...
i &apos;ll be with you .
it &apos;s me .
is your source still in place ?
yes .
good .
i need something from him .
base ops , this is trailer . we have a 20 on the target .
copy . stay with her .
we &apos;re gonna head over to the pi delta exchange .
i think tom &apos;s gonna be there .
shut up .
tommy !
she gave you a drawer ?
it was a gesture of convenience .
and what did you put in it ?
- why do you care ?
- why do i care ?
do you know how spoiled you are ?
i wish i had a girlfriend to say ,
&quot; hey , you want a drawer ? &quot;
i &apos;ll give you a drawer at my place .
i don &apos;t want a drawer in your place .
hey , it &apos;s me .
you okay ?
marshall told me your father shut you down .
i just needed to get out , cool down .
dad was right . like that &apos;s news .
i just wish there was more i could do .
we &apos;re working on corroborating elsa &apos;s intel .
where are you ?
at the drugstore , picking up some pictures i had developed .
i think there &apos;s this great one of us .
you could hang it in your hallway by the coatrack .
what ?
although some of the pictures might not come out because i used the wrong film speed .
next time , he said to keep in mind
i should use a slower roll .
pen .
i &apos;ll probably be another 20 minutes .
i &apos;ll come over when i &apos;m done ?
bye .
what ?
she said she wanted to hang a picture next to the coatrack .
so ?
she &apos;s never been to my place . i don &apos;t have a coatrack .
maybe it was some kind of message .
what &apos;d she say exactly ?
she said , &quot; keep in mind i should use a slower roll . &quot;
and ... this bag , please .
where &apos;s your bathroom ?
but i like it . i like this product .
- i &apos;ve used this one before .
- you have ?
i tried that once and broke out .
oh , really ?
thanks .
oh , my ... are you sigma gammas ?
i was president of my chapter in west virginia .
no way .
i swear to god !
president ?
you still have the exchange with the pi delts ?
- yes , we do .
- you wanna come ?
- can i ? - absolutely .
i have been homesick since i graduated .
thank you for inviting me !
wait , i got it .
she &apos;s using skip-sequence ciphertext .
take the first letter from every word and rearrange them .
she &apos;s going to russia .
you wanted to see me ?
sydney knew i was listening to your phone conversation .
she also knew by the time i decoded her anagram , she &apos;d be halfway to russia .
i &apos;m gonna give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you had every intention of reporting that to me .
i &apos;m giving you this consideration because when sydney makes contact with you again , you &apos;re going to tell me exactly where she is .
if i &apos;d known what she was doing , i would have tried to stop her .
now that she &apos;s gone , there &apos;s nothing we can do to change her mind .
she &apos;s got 40 hours to find caplan .
why not give her backup ?
if it &apos;s not obvious to you by now , everything i do is in the service of protecting sydney .
for all we know , elsa caplan &apos;s working with sloane .
for all we know , she was a conspirator in her husband &apos;s abduction , which means sydney could be walking into a trap .
or she is about to save neil caplan &apos;s life .
this is not a debate .
just because you &apos;ve gotten comfortable with my daughter doesn &apos;t mean you should be comfortable with me .
if you don &apos;t report your next contact with sydney immediately ,
i will take action that you will regret .
okay , partner , let &apos;s get ready to ride .
hold up here . here you go !
get up ! get up ! you &apos;re no cowboy !
this is cowboy bar . speak english .
we have a mutual friend .
i don &apos;t care .
this is eight-seconds table .
everyone here has ridden bull for eight seconds .
goodbye .
oh , god .
something like that ?
something like that .
now , champion ... who is our mutual friend ?
elsa caplan .
when exactly did you talk to elsa ?
yesterday .
we are old friends .
elsa &apos;s parents were in kholokov &apos;s class at the red banner with my parents .
what do you need ?
i need a tracking device .
latest s vr issue .
$ 50,000 cash .
u.s. bucks only .
deal .
open the door .
i want to see my son .
look , my family is all i care about .
your family ?
the one you manufactured in order to steal classified information ?
you don &apos;t know anything about me .
you couldn &apos;t be more wrong .
you &apos;re sydney &apos;s father .
irina derevko was your wife .
which makes me an expert on someone like you .
it started as a job .
a duty to your country .
that it required you to prostitute yourself was a small price to pay for serving the motherland .
at first , everything went as planned .
then ... surely an accident ... you got pregnant .
you considered terminating the pregnancy , but ... selfishly , you didn &apos;t .
you hoped that becoming a mother would redeem you , would absolve your guilt .
- you &apos;re wrong !
- but you continued to lie and deceive both your husband and son .
i am not irina derevko !
i probably care more about your son than you do .
- that is not true .
- if i have my way ... you &apos;re never going to see your son again .
don &apos;t you dare take my son away from me !
don &apos;t you take my son away !
weiss .
weiss , it &apos;s me .
sorry to call you , but vaughn &apos;s phone is probably tapped .
is he there ?
guess who .
- syd ? - listen to me .
i &apos;ve got the tracker .
i input the codes elsa gave us .
i found caplan in a building in saria , spain .
it used to be a software company .
i &apos;m on my way now .
your father thinks you &apos;re walking into a trap .
i &apos;m not sure he &apos;s wrong .
i &apos;m supposed to convince you to come home .
i will , when i have caplan .
my father can &apos;t see straight when he looks at elsa .
he only sees my mother .
and if this ends up being a mistake , so be it .
i believe her .
i &apos;m coming with you .
- i can &apos;t ask you to do that .
- you don &apos;t have to .
there &apos;s an alley in saria behind the gandara hotel .
meet me there .
jack is gonna shoot you in the face .
give me a half-hour head start .
tell him she called on your phone , and you gave it to me .
we only have 10 hours to find caplan .
if we end up sharing a cell in federal prison ,
i &apos;m not giving you a drawer .
okay , i got to go .
- i &apos;m gonna be late .
- you work for a travel magazine .
- tell them you &apos;re traveling .
- i wish i could .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s will , right ?
i &apos;ve seen you in the briefings .
i &apos;m kind of new around here myself .
it &apos;s marshall flinkman .
_removed_
do they have you parking in the federal annex ?
&apos;cause i have to walk a half a mile to get here in the morning , and i &apos;m exhausted by the time ...
i shouldn &apos;t complain .
it &apos;s the only exercise i really get .
although i did see a gym .
excuse me .
i got ...
that &apos;s all right .
let &apos;s get some lunch or something .
the cia lunch .
hey , honey , you got a sec ?
yeah , yeah , yeah . what &apos;s up ?
are you near a computer ?
i was pulling up a recipe on my laptop , and it crashed . what ?
do you want me to pull up a recipe ?
- would you mind ? - sure .
what &apos;s the website ?
okay , what do you need ?
will you tell me what kind of fish they list ? hold on .
let me find it .
thank you for coming .
how much time do we have ?
12 minutes .
did you bring gear ?
did i bring gear ?
i spoke to weiss after we landed .
satellite &apos;s picked up five figures inside the building .
basement level , north wing .
sloane could be a block from here .
my mother .
if they are , they won &apos;t surrender to us .
i know .
what about the perimeter ?
no activity .
roof access will be our best bet .
not that i &apos;m a fan of you disobeying the cia , but that was pretty good .
the way you got away .
thank you .
it &apos;s me .
i need you to do something else for me .
who are you , anyway ?
what are you ?
22 ?
_removed_
what are you doing working for a guy like sloane ?
what do you expect to get out of all of this ?
i was sent to school in england at a very young age .
out of necessity , one becomes self-reliant and , perhaps , prematurely ambitious .
i &apos;m like anyone , mr. caplan .
what i want is that which i never had .
you &apos;re gonna kill me , aren &apos;t you ?
you wouldn &apos;t share any of that stuff with me if you expected me to live .
i suggest you keep working .
i &apos;ll go around .
syd !
alto !
is arvin sloane in this building ?
or irina derevko ?
no , no , no , no . but a blond guy just took off . - sark ?
- that &apos;s him , yeah .
i &apos;ll go after him .
what the hell &apos;s that for ?
you have to listen to what i &apos;m gonna say .
you won &apos;t want to believe me , but you have to , or you will die in less than 60 seconds .
what ?
freeze !
your wife , elsa .
she works for russian intelligence .
i know .
six years ago , the nsa recruited me .
they told me i was a target .
they had intel that i was gonna be approached .
you &apos;re nsa ?
they recruited me out of caltech , even though , if you ask them , they &apos;ll deny any affiliation with me .
i knew elsa was a spy the day we met .
your wife injected you with a cyanide caplet .
we have to remove it now ! - what ?
- listen to me .
i came this far because of this .
- she wouldn &apos;t try and kill me .
- she didn &apos;t . her handlers did .
when did she implant this thing ?
right after you met .
you have less than 30 seconds before you die .
we have to remove this right now .
give me your left wrist .
_removed_
no . i &apos;m okay .
- oh , god . come on .
- hang on .
hang on .
god !
thanks .
no matter what you may think of me ,
i would have done anything to bring you home .
i know .
we both have a lot to figure out .
i don &apos;t think either of us are in a position to pass any judgments .
i love you .
i love you , too .
i know i &apos;m not in a position to ask you for any favors .
but whatever you plan on doing to me , just please leave vaughn out of it .
vaughn will be escorting the caplans to bainbridge island .
i &apos;ve granted elsa defector status .
she is not irina derevko .
we downloaded the dna database caplan decrypted from the computer he was working on .
we finally have a lead on sloane and derevko .
good .
sydney , if you go around me again ,
i &apos;ll have you transferred .
and finding them will no longer be part of your job description .
i owe you an apology .
you don &apos;t have to explain .
let me say this .
when marcus first told me about sd-6 ,
i felt so betrayed .
in part , i blamed you for that .
your world has these rules that force good people to lie , even to those they &apos;re closest to .
before i could accept that ,
i had to understand it .
i rescinded the transfer order .
diane rescinded the order .
mr. bristow . mr. bristow .
yes , marshall ?
i was doing some spelunking on the cia network .
mapping it , really .
you can relax , because the death-star plans are not in the main computer .
anyway , i did find a bandwidth discrepancy .
i thought it was a trojan virus implanted on the system , but unless it was locked into a renaming ram cache ...
marshall !
please , english .
i found a massive information hemorrhage .
someone without authorization accessed the system and downloaded 10 gigabytes of satellite footage from tuscany .
tuscany ?
how did they hack in ?
they didn &apos;t . it came from this office .
no , there &apos;s no way the agency has season tickets for the lakers .
i &apos;m telling you . 4 seats , 12 rows back .
by this point , i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m surprised , but i am .
i &apos;ll see you after i get the kids .
good night .
good night , diane .
- good night .
- good night .
feels good ... having it out in the open .
see you tomorrow .
oh ! by the way ...
diane ! oh , god !

startofdocumentplaceholder
africa . in the four years of making this series , we &apos;ve been to some astonishing places and seen animals behaving in ways that have never been filmed before .
but africa has another story to tell .
the wildlife of this continent has seen more changes in the last 50 years than it has in the last two million .
changing landscapes and changing climate .
today &apos;s animals are facing unprecedented challenges .
whilst around them , africa &apos;s human population is growing at nearly double the global rate .
there is an increasing urgency to understand and , crucially , to conserve the wildlife of this great continent .
today , there is a new generation of naturalists and scientists who are fighting to save the wild places and the animals that live in them .
_removed_
this is the greatest wildlife continent on the planet and what happens here is relevant to us all .
so what is the future of wild africa ?
this animal has become the world &apos;s number-one target for poachers .
its kind has been hunted almost to the point of extinction .
it &apos;s now so rare that this individual is watched over day and night .
this is the black rhinoceros .
and black rhinoceros are notorious for being rather grumpy and suddenly charging .
but he is in great danger , because he has on his nose ...
.. that horn ...
.. which is worth its weight in gold .
the demand for rhino horn has rocketed .
there has been a 3,000 % increase in poaching just in the last five years .
_removed_
rhinos are a lucrative target for organised crime . in chinese medicine , it &apos;s believed that rhino horn can reduce fever and some vietnamese sell it as a cure for everything , from cancer to hangovers . it &apos;s made of keratin , the same substance as hair and nail , and it has no clinically proven medicinal value .
but it has made every black rhino in africa a target . they &apos;ve all been killed in uganda and rwanda , and there are only around 600 left here in kenya .
but these are not poachers .
these are protectors .
and that protection is overseen by rhino expert dr matthew mutinda , one of the kenya wildlife services &apos; top vets .
&apos;black rhinos are critically endangered . &apos;
that is what here , at lewa wildlife conservancy , we &apos;re trying to do save the animal , provide a safe and secure sanctuary where the animal can breed and live freely .
there aren &apos;t many true wild rhinos left in africa . most , like these , in lewa wildlife conservancy , are under armed guard .
this young female has reached the age when matthew must do some health checks , including taking blood samples . this will help deter poachers and traffickers , as dna in illegally traded rhino horn can be tracked back to its origin .
if you have to do anaesthesia in the wild , you will expect some degree of risk .
this female has reacted badly to the anaesthetic .
she &apos;s not breathing .
it &apos;s a rare and extremely serious situation .
he knows that the next few minutes are crucial . and when an animal is this big , there &apos;s only one way to get the heart going again when you &apos;re out in the bush .
thanks to matthew &apos;s quick thinking , they can hear that she is breathing again .
they &apos;ve got to get her back on her feet .
_removed_
mission accomplished . it &apos;s been an ordeal , but now , this rhino can be tracked and protected for the rest of her life .
within minutes , she &apos;s grazing peacefully again with her mother . it may seem heartless to treat an animal like that , but we have to keep tabs on them and be able to identify individuals .
they &apos;re in great danger . even now , on average , one rhino is killed by poachers every day in africa .
there are so few black rhino left in kenya that we &apos;re getting to know each individual .
but this is still a creature that can surprise us .
previously , it was widely believed that black rhinos were largely solitary creatures .
here , in the kalahari , a starlight camera reveals that they may be much more sociable than many thought .
this water-hole gathering is an enchanting window into the past .
early explorers reported seeing a rhino behind every bush . before the invention of the gun , there were probably hundreds of thousands of rhinos across the continent .
the people protecting rhinos in africa are striving to ensure that we &apos;ll still be able to witness wonderful scenes like this in 50 years &apos; time .
_removed_
the human population of the continent has just exceeded one billion and many wild animals are being hunted commercially for food .
some , legally , but many , illegally .
wildlife meat is often sold as goat or beef .
the amount is astonishing .
millions of tonnes are eaten across africa every year .
_removed_
but commercial hunting is not just affecting the grazers .
as the prey decreases , it &apos;s affecting the predators too . 50 years ago , there were about half a million lions in africa .
today , there are less than 30,000 . but in one particular part of africa , things are improving in a quite extraordinary way .
these hunters have become part of a new and unlikely alliance . in recent years , hungry lions have increasingly been killing livestock .
one group of traditional maasai have reacted in a very untraditional way .
the maasai are cattle herders who don &apos;t eat wild animals .
_removed_
maasai and lions are ancient adversaries .
a lion hunt is still a rite of passage for young maasai warriors like olubi lairumbe .
for me and any maasai , killing a lion is the ultimate fulfilment of a truly accomplished maasai .
nothing compares to that .
there is nobody who knows more about living alongside lions than the maasai themselves .
i met olubi and some of the other warriors in his village to find out about their relationship with the local pride .
how many lions are there around here ?
_removed_
so they all have names ?
every single lion has a name .
a maasai name . and when you see a lion , do you know how it &apos;s going to behave ?
it depends on the lion .
_removed_
_removed_
only if you threaten it .
mmm , well , i hope the next lion knows that . olubi killed his first lion when he was just 17 , after it attacked his cattle .
_removed_
and that led to a remarkable turnaround .
the maasai respect all living things .
and i began to feel guilty about the lion that i had killed .
_removed_
olubi had a dramatic change of heart .
he turned his back on hundreds of years of maasai tradition .
_removed_
instead of hunting lions , olubi will be protecting them . he teamed up with stephanie dolrenry , who helped pioneer the project .
just by respecting their traditions and also bringing in their ecological knowledge , it &apos;s been hugely successful .
they know their areas , they know how to track lions , they &apos;ve been doing it for generation after generation . they know how to track them , they know how to hunt them , they know how to find them .
this is only a small-scale project .
but with lion numbers as low as they are , they need all the help they can get .
_removed_
he &apos;s able to warn villages to move their cattle when the pride is in the area .
_removed_
no lions have been killed in the immediate area since the project began .
by combining the science , both ancient and contemporary , they &apos;re beginning to make a real difference .
there &apos;s so much to be learned .
_removed_
and , in return , they teach us about the environment and how things have changed in their environment .
and it &apos;s a really neat exchange .
you can &apos;t say we &apos;re the biologists or the teachers .
or the guardians or the teachers .
we &apos;re both teachers and we &apos;re both students and i think that &apos;s ...
_removed_
critically , at the heart of this project is a huge attitude change by these maasai warriors .
_removed_
&apos;and their willingness to share knowledge with other communities &apos; means that projects like this could be repeated &apos; in other parts of africa . &apos;
traditionally , when a warrior killed a lion , he took the name of the lion .
_removed_
_removed_
the scheme is a huge success .
there are about 100 lions involved in the scheme in this neighbourhood .
this is 21st-century conservation in action .
perhaps the biggest threat to wildlife is the competition for space with the rapidly-growing human population .
the rich volcanic soils are extremely fertile .
it &apos;s one of the most intensively cultivated areas in africa .
but the farmers also share this region with one of our closest relatives .
this is home to the last 800-or-so wild mountain gorillas left on earth .
we know a great deal about these animals , they &apos;ve been closely studied for 50 years .
one strong silverback male keeps everyone in order .
and gorilla family life is mostly peaceful . until a few generations ago , mountain gorillas , hidden in the seclusion of their forests were seldom seen by human beings .
but their habitat was steadily being carved away , and now these gorillas are marooned on the volcanic slopes in a sea of farmland .
the fact that gorillas now regularly come into contact with people not only means an increased threat of poaching , but also of disease .
gorillas have little or no resistance to the bugs that we carry .
numbers here once dropped to around 250 .
they were facing extinction .
action had to be taken . the boundaries of the national park were strictly enforced , halting the encroachment of farmland .
and it was decided that the only solution was to intensively manage the remaining gorillas .
teams of scientists constantly monitor them .
their forests are patrolled to cut poachers &apos; snares .
and vets watch their health closely .
_removed_
this is funded mostly through eco-tourism and donations from all over the world .
mountain gorillas are now back from the brink . this level of human intervention might not be ideal , but it &apos;s working .
_removed_
intensive management within a protected area may represent the only future for many african species .
_removed_
what happens if the animal you &apos;re trying to protect is not suited to park life ?
elephants require vast amounts of space to roam .
_removed_
given the chance , they will even move between countries in search of the best food .
_removed_
this was the scene in amboseli national park in 2009 .
_removed_
and this was the worst drought for half a century .
60 % of zebras and 95 % of wildebeests were wiped out .
the seasonal rains had failed for the last two years .
and the elephants that lived here were slowly starving .
the park created to protect them is now surrounded by farmland .
the elephants had little choice of where else to go .
_removed_
they are the front line for elephant protection in the park .
and they know these animals better than anyone else .
nora njiraini and katito and soila sayialel .
_removed_
they are family to us .
hello , anastasia ! the sisters have been following these elephants for over 25 years , trying to ensure their safety , particularly at times when life is tough for these animals .
it really was terrible .
there was nothing actually to feed on .
i even went and asked the old maasai men whether they have ever experienced such a drought .
_removed_
in 2009 ... .. we lost quite a number of elephants .
i think we lost about 400 elephants .
and it started with the young ones .
elephants usually escape drought by moving into other less affected areas .
but africa &apos;s human population is growing at double the global rate .
and traditional migration routes have been cut by the development of towns , cities , farmland and roads , leaving these elephants stuck .
this young calf is starving ... .. and there is nothing they can do to help .
for the sisters , who know each elephant personally , this is a terrible moment .
it is something that we feel in our hearts .
you can imagine the kind of feelings that we get .
you know , knowing those elephants and seeing something like that happen .
it really touches us .
it was a tough year for all the young elephants in the region .
we lost all the calves that were born that year .
_removed_
there was nothing the sisters could do to save the baby . but they were determined to save any elephants they could , especially mothers who could breed again . they found this female stuck in the mud , exhausted in a dried-up lake bed .
the elephant that got stuck in the mud was kolida .
_removed_
she was there for quite a long time .
a maasai reported it to us and we had to combine efforts with the kenya wildlife services people .
weighing about three tonnes , kolida is just too heavy to shift by hand .
she is weakening fast .
so the next morning , heavy machinery is brought in . after two days stuck in the mud , kolida is exhausted , but she &apos;s up on her feet again .
the rains did return to amboseli . and thanks in part to the work of those dedicated three women , elephant numbers are now beginning to rise again .
there &apos;s no doubt that this was an extremely severe event .
but is it an isolated incident or a developing pattern ? they say that with global warming , we actually don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
but we just have to cross fingers and hope for a better future . given the opportunity , the numbers of elephants in east africa will recover .
especially , if they &apos;re given the freedom to range widely and so avoid the harshest conditions .
one solution to help elephants find the space they need is to link parks together and provide safe routes between them .
elephants are great travellers and here , in this part of kenya , they regularly moved from the lowlands up the side of the mountains to feed in the forests up there .
but then , the human population of kenya grew and roads like this one were constructed , penning the elephants down in the lowland , where they created havoc amongst the farms .
_removed_
and then someone suggested building an underpass . within 24 hours of it being completed , one elephant had passed through .
_removed_
simple ideas like this underpass are a lifeline for these elephants , especially in times of drought .
africa &apos;s climate is certainly changing .
some parts of the continent have become 3.5 degrees centigrade hotter in the past 20 years .
at the summit of africa &apos;s most famous mountain , kilimanjaro , 80 % of its permanent ice fields have disappeared .
_removed_
all over africa , the mountainous regions are often the first indicators of climate change .
here , in the ethiopian highlands live very unusual-looking creatures .
gelada baboons .
climate change refugees . although this region of ethiopia lies in the tropics , up at 4,000 metres , it doesn &apos;t feel like it . unlike most african animals , geladas are adapted to life in the cold .
_removed_
now , there is only one . with the warming climate , their grazing is becoming more and more scarce , restricted to cooler and higher places .
these geladas are being forced higher into the mountains .
_removed_
this is a species living on the edge . even though they &apos;re isolated on the mountain tops , they &apos;re not immune to our influence . as a result of changing climate , these gelada baboons may soon be gone from our planet .
africa is the world &apos;s hottest continent .
and there is no doubt it &apos;s getting warmer .
the sahara is the largest hot desert in the world .
very little can survive in these harsh conditions . along the desert edge , life clings on in the face of encroaching sands .
but for how long ? alongside the wildlife , 22 million people struggle to make a living on these desert margins .
can anything be done to stop the sand overwhelming this fragile land ?
one idea is to build a green wall of trees across 11 countries .
the project has already started in senegal .
_removed_
getting 11 countries to work together is not easy and simply irrigating a 5,000-mile long belt of trees is an ambitious task .
but all over africa , people are recognising how important it is to have trees as part of their local landscape .
this group of volunteers has planted nearly 100 million saplings .
they are just one of countless similar groups and individuals taking it upon themselves to reforest their own part of this great continent .
trees are essential for the future of the continent and indeed , to the rest of the planet .
this is the congo basin .
it &apos;s one of the most biologically important forests on earth and it &apos;s not just because of the concentration of plants and animals that live here .
it &apos;s because it &apos;s also one of the powerhouses behind the planet &apos;s wind and rain .
each hectare of trees releases , as vapour , almost 190,000 litres of water a year .
this water passes into the atmosphere to be transported around the entire globe .
that means the heart of the world &apos;s weather lies in tropical forests .
unfortunately , there &apos;s an almost insatiable demand in europe and china for hardwood from these very forests .
and that is having an enormous impact . as more tropical forest is felled , some scientists are seeing a correlation with changing storm patterns across europe and america .
and it &apos;s likely to become more extreme .
staggeringly , 50 % of the congo basin forest has been allocated for logging .
the future of africa &apos;s forest has never been more critical for us all .
but the consequences of global warming aren &apos;t limited to the land .
africa is almost completely surrounded by oceans .
here on the east coast , there are animals feeling the changing climate in a most surprising way .
this is a young female green turtle .
during her lifetime , she will travel thousands of miles through the ocean looking for food .
turtles return to the same beach from which they hatched to lay their own eggs .
the eggs are buried in the sand and the hatchlings will emerge after about two months .
but there &apos;s a strange thing about turtle eggs .
and that is the temperature at which the eggs are kept will determine the sex of most of the hatchlings .
if the sand temperature is high , they will be female , if it &apos;s low , they will be male .
global warming could have a crucial effect on turtle populations .
and this young female may find it very difficult in years to come to find a male with which to mate .
but a local conservation group recognised that the odds are stacking up against these little turtles .
there &apos;s not much they can do about climate change , but they have got together with the local fishermen to try and improve the turtles &apos; chances of survival .
every turtle counts . so , each time one is found injured or accidentally caught in the nets , it &apos;s brought to kahindi changawa and his team .
so we began with only 16 fishermen altogether in 1998 .
now we have hundreds of fishermen working with us .
grazing by turtles is essential for the health of the beds of seagrass and these are the home of shrimps and lobsters and that , of course , helps fishermen too .
the project has a turtle rehabilitation centre and for the last two years , it &apos;s become home to shella .
she had an accident with a boat .
_removed_
she lost three ribs and her spine was damaged .
it &apos;s now in the process of healing back together .
shella &apos;s injuries have affected her buoyancy .
she &apos;s healed well and to encourage her to exercise her flippers properly , she has , every day , a little trip to the seaside . we usually take shella for a sea bath on a daily basis , and the reason for doing that is to give her enough room to get exercises .
she gets an opportunity to eat her natural food . we believe it keeps her fit and the other thing is , she gets to use her rear flippers quite often .
_removed_
it &apos;s really enjoyable .
very few people have the privilege like i do of swimming with the turtles and having that fun .
i do enjoy what i &apos;m doing .
shella certainly did get stronger , but the hope that some day she might swim out in the open was not to be fulfilled .
_removed_
this kind of work will inevitably have setbacks .
but there are always new turtles to be cared for .
_removed_
_removed_
like these ones here .
_removed_
otherwise the turtle &apos;s healthy .
shall we have a go ?
since 1998 till now , we &apos;ve released over 8,200 turtles . it makes me feel proud and privileged , we &apos;ve done lots of work with the community and changing the attitudes and their behaviours .
i guess our job as an organisation was really successful .
a young turtle like that could lay 6,000-7,000 eggs in her lifetime .
_removed_
saving just one individual requires huge effort and of course , saving a species requires even more .
but these heroic efforts are only ever going to be a partial solution .
every individual animal is part of a much bigger story , part of an interconnected web of plants , animals and the landscape itself that make up an entire ecosystem .
saving ecosystems is the key to africa &apos;s wild future .
gorongosa in mozambique is a modern day jurassic park .
it &apos;s ruled by some of the world &apos;s biggest crocodiles .
some of these monsters are six metres long and close to 50 years old .
somehow they managed to escape a civil war lasting nearly 20 years , which swept through gorongosa .
95 % of all the other large animals were wiped out .
_removed_
this was a thriving tourist attraction .
a wild paradise . visitors flocked from around the world , drawn by the vast range and abundance of the wildlife . the most popular spot for tourists was an old restaurant , a look-out post for the local lions .
the restaurant has long gone .
along with the lions .
gorongosa looked empty and beyond rescue .
but not to everyone .
a brave and ambitious project began to try and restore the park to its former richness and splendour .
the first stage is to find out which animals as well as crocodiles are still here .
so the team is mapping and counting all the big animals they see in the park .
but it soon became clear that these big animals were only part of the story .
perhaps even more important might be the little ones hidden underfoot .
it &apos;s understanding these creatures that is attracting some of the best minds in the scientific world .
_removed_
_removed_
_removed_
you see there &apos;s a big nest ...
_removed_
_removed_
_removed_
_removed_
they &apos;re what i like to call the little things that run the earth .
it &apos;s the rich diversity of insect life here that gives gorongosa the prospect of a future .
these creatures form the basis of life in the park .
this is so much fun .
the creatures that do most of the work , turn most of the energy , save most of the material and allow us to reinsert big animals with some confidence .
have you got it in the vial yet ?

professor wilson was one of the first scientists to explore this area together with local wildlife biologist tonga tortuda .
if you could gather them all up , all these little invertebrate creatures , and weigh them , they would weigh far more than all of the big animals put together , even in a fully restored park . it &apos;s these little creatures , together with the plants and trees , that still make this place a viable option for reintroducing bigger animals .
i can &apos;t be sure that &apos;s a new species , but this is the kind of thing that might be .
this park came that close to vanishing ... .. and i &apos;m happy to report it is coming back .
and this is one of the great stories .
it &apos;s inspirational , i think . it &apos;s a fine , shining example of what to do with all our parks , even those that have been damaged by human activity .
but there &apos;s another reason why gorongosa is important for the future of africa and perhaps for us all .
it is here , in this park , that people come to see , not just the big animals that thrill us , but they will see earth as it looked and felt before the coming of humanity .
saving big animals is important , but to do that with any real success , we have to start understanding and preserving the plants and insects that support an ecosystem .
it &apos;s this that will allow the larger animals to thrive .
gorongosa is a real success story .
_removed_
while it can never be exactly the same as it was before the war , it can still become a rich and thriving ecosystem .
the scale of the challenge across africa is enormous .
after all , it &apos;s a huge continent . the united kingdom , china , the united states of america , india ,
japan and most of the rest of europe would all fit within its borders .
africa still retains 45 % of the earth &apos;s uncultivated land .
it &apos;s still the greatest wilderness on earth and that is why it &apos;s important .
human beings have lived alongside wildlife here longer than anywhere else .
but now in the 21st century , animal numbers are at a critical level .
_removed_
that means taking care of the animals and lands where they live , so there is still space for us all to coexist .
nobody knows what the future has in store for this little calf . or indeed , how the changes that inevitably are going to take place in africa will affect the rest of the world and this little animal .
but one thing is certain .
what happens here is more important than it has ever been and that the relationship of the rest of the world to this great continent and the creatures that live in it is more important than ever before .
on whichever part of the planet we live , we all have a part to play in what sort of future this wild continent has .
_removed_
it &apos;s one of our most ambitious trips with lots of locations to visit and many technical hurdles to overcome .
_removed_
to the west are vast rainforests the size of india .
helicopters enable us to go to extraordinary landscapes ... we &apos;re heading off to do the very first visit , the opening of the whole africa series with david .
how do you like the view from my office ?
.. and attempt air-to-air filming .

i &apos;m flying over the great rift valley in east africa .
but perhaps the most ambitious task for this shoot is the filming with black rhinoceros .
they have a reputation for being aggressive and with poor eyesight , they &apos;re likely to charge objects or people they don &apos;t recognise .
but the plight of the rhino is such an important story that we want to get as close to them as possible .
we also want to meet the people who are working to protect them .
so our team have come to assess the viability of filming up close with a rhino called elvis who &apos;s been reared by humans .
he should be safer than a wild rhino , but there &apos;s still a risk he could be unpredictable with strangers .
wildlife ranger , tonga kaseyo has brought up elvis by hand and knows that tickling him gently with a stick keeps him calm .
but if anything were to go seriously wrong , there would be little he could do against a one-tonne elvis .
and this fact hasn &apos;t escaped cameraman mike fox .
_removed_
_removed_
if he decided to bat us all into the next world ... he would do .
director kate broome checks with tonga that it &apos;s safe for the crew to get closer .
normally , we have to stay in the land rovers . they &apos;re saying it &apos;s ok to go in . this is such an extraordinary opportunity , to be this close to ... a black rhino .
the trial goes well with elvis and the stage is set for future filming .
several weeks later , the team are back and this time i &apos;ve joined them .
but elvis &apos;s mood has changed .
he seems more wilful . &apos; now , i &apos;ve stood by many wild animals in my time , &apos; but i &apos;m not as fast on my pins as i used to be . &apos; &apos; we don &apos;t want to test elvis &apos;s patience , so we get on with filming . &apos;
a horn that is worth its weight in gold .
and one way ... .. of protecting him ...
.. would be ... to cut that horn off the nose .
how is it ?
_removed_
&apos;the team check that they have what they need &apos; and elvis lets us know that he &apos;s had enough . &apos;
_removed_
_removed_
&apos;but actually , it &apos;s a positive sign &apos; that elvis is not as friendly this time .
&apos;tonga and his colleagues want elvis to live more like a wild rhino &apos; and develop a wariness of humans &apos; that may offer him some protection from poachers . &apos;
good luck to you , elvis . whilst filming , we &apos;re lucky enough to have a very well equipped camp .
it &apos;s in the bush and there &apos;s no escaping the wild animals .
one of the great , wonderful things about camping out in the middle of the open is the animals .
but it can also be one of the dangerous / annoying things .
absolutely . in the annoying category , vervet monkeys .
vervet monkeys have stolen my ferrero rocher and one of my glow sticks from our medical supplies .
i &apos;ll identify the naughty one that &apos;s been stealing our stuff .
and they leave little presents for us when they &apos;ve been in , just as a calling card .
but camp manager andres finds more worrying animal signs .
_removed_
some must have come in and i don &apos;t know ...
you can see a few scratches .
i think maybe he was wanting to look at himself in the mirror . &apos; lions in camp are worrying enough , &apos; but there i was reading my book when ... &apos;
whoa ! &apos; .. a cape buffalo arrives . &apos;
&apos;the most grumpy and dangerous of the big five african animals . &apos;
mike ! stay in your tent .
shall we get david to get in the tent ? buffalo usually move in herds , so there &apos;s something odd about him .
it may be that it was brought up as a calf and is humanised .
or it may be that he &apos;s an outcast from the herd in some way and that he &apos;s rather grumpy and fed up with life .
but i think it &apos;s just hot and he &apos;s just plodding around and wondering where he might get a drink and a decent sandwich .
_removed_
the team &apos;s filming has coincided with the newest arrival at lewa , a baby rhino in need of 24-hour care .
this little chap was born blind and is guided everywhere by his keepers .
they took him away from his mother a few weeks ago , because she couldn &apos;t protect him any more .
he &apos;s very vulnerable so he would have been killed by predators .
it &apos;s like filling up a petrol tank .
&apos;every rhino is precious &apos; and so it seems a fitting end for the final scene of the series . &apos;
no-one knows what the future holds for this little creature , nor indeed what changes will take place on the great continent on which he lives .

david attenborough &apos;s made me cry . but just as we think we &apos;re finishing , someone won &apos;t let us go .
_removed_
&apos;he starts to squeak and we &apos;re able to have a little chat . &apos;
_removed_
_removed_
he &apos;s more likely to be responding to sound if he hasn &apos;t got the vision .
_removed_
are you coming back ?
&apos;there is hope for this little fellow . &apos;
&apos;he &apos;s due to have an operation on his eyes which may mean &apos; &apos; that as an adult he can be returned to the wild &apos; &apos; just like elvis . &apos;
i do hope he gets a cataract operation .
it would be marvellous if he did .
enchanting creature .

the other two guys have even greater spiritual power than him .

i can &apos;t shoulder all this !

i &apos;m in no condition to fight them now !
there he is ! it &apos;s kurama !
you don &apos;t need to be so wary . i have no intention of fighting or running away .
i have a request .
i will assuredly return the ankokukyo to you .
you know !
what he says is too good to be true !
three more days ... that &apos;s right when the moon is full !
that &apos;s the day the ankokukyo that kurama holds exhibits its greatest magical power !
that mirror reflects the desires of those who look into it .
it &apos;s said that it then grants that desire. but it &apos;s a mystery as to whatever that is .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s trying to figure out what it is during these three days ! right ?
that &apos;s right ... i have a feeling that he &apos;s not all that bad a guy .
what are you saying !
it was his partner that wore you ragged like this !
the three of them were fighting among each other .
but that kurama guy was trying to pull out of their group .
but you &apos;ll have to let me back out .
i didn &apos;t get the feeling he was lying .
what could be up with kurama ... ?
_removed_
thank you so much ! hey !
we &apos;re in the middle of talking about something very important right now !
what &apos;s this ? is it anything that can &apos;t be said in front of your mother ! ?

it has nothing to do with that ! you go directly to where kurama specified !

shuichi is the name i &apos;ve adopted in the human realm .

i want to use the ankokukyo here to save her ! and receive his judgement .
why would a yokai go that far for a human ? why indeed .
i &apos;m not too sure myself .
but there is one thing i know for certain .
i owe her an awful lot .
she did an excellent job of raising me .
it was the first time i ever thought about repaying her kindness .
why are you telling me all this ?
maybe i just wanted someone to hear about it .
you had faith in me .
your mother ... ! she &apos;s in extremely critical condition .
and so ... ?
tonight will probably prove the steepest of passes for her .
we &apos;ll do our best .
i have to do it !
- you &apos;re gonna use the ankokukyo !
? - yeah .
i heard you gotta offer up something .
do you know what it is ?
it &apos;s a demonic mirror that grants your wish as it takes your life. because it has changed owners so many times .
i wonder if that girl is all right .
receive the light of the moon and awaken !
and reflect my desire on your surface !
a lifetime of happiness for this woman .
is that your desire ?
it is. aren &apos;t you making a mistake !
it won &apos;t amount to anything !
this is the only way !
i shall grant your desire !
mom !
what are you doing !

right ! ?
the sight of a mother &apos;s crying face after losing her son ... it &apos;s unbearable !
there is nothing more discomforting !

yusuke !
o- ow ... !
it &apos;s situations like that where i act before thinking about what will come afterward . thinking about it now makes me shudder ! are you here ?
dummy ... i got hold of the ankokukyo !
i have decided to grant the wish even without a life . i hear she &apos;s over the pass !
but her condition is well on its way to complete recovery !
it utterly astonishes me how much force of life some people have ! shuichi ... mom ...
isn &apos;t this just great ! ?
i guess so . now there &apos;s only one more treasure to go. that &apos;s really outstanding !

thank you for saving my mom .
tonight , at 11.68 , there was a extreme shootout in a south central laundromat .
unidentified sources at the crime scene claim that a renegade ex-cop went on a shooting rampage that has left an unconfirmed 27 bystanders wounded and another 3.6 dead .
with more on this tragic
details are still sketchy at this point , harry .
however , anonymous official has heard rumor that 1.4 of the dead are indeed children .
the mayor &apos;s office has released no actual details at this time .
however , a highly placed authority has implied the identity of the killer to be known :
the name &apos; brick bardo &apos; was overheard .
brick bardo is a detective that was involved in the fillmore incident earlier this year .
- we &apos;ve come back but first : we &apos;ve got a travel advice ...
there &apos;s an old friend ...
wants to see you , bard .
rise and shine .
i saw the news tonight .
you &apos;re a very violent man , bardo .
yes , i know .
it &apos;s a violent universe .
i bet you thought you &apos;d seen the last of me .
i am seeing the last of you , sprug .
after our last encounter , this is all they managed to salvage .
let &apos;s see if i &apos;d remember the first time .
- i flew off your left arm .
- and most of my left foot .
and then there was the space extortion .
what did i take ?
two ... or three legs ?
among other things .
the last time ,
all i remember was your head , rolling around in the parking lot .
i didn &apos;t think it was enough to save .
what do you want ?
i &apos;ll tell you what i want , bardo .
50000 molecular ions .
and i get them too , you know why ?
because my cruiser is loaded with a dimensional fusion bomb , that will blow the .
it will never happen .
why not ?
somehow you &apos;ll fuck it up .
you always fuck it up .
no , bardo .
you &apos;ve always screwed up my plans .
but this time you don &apos;t have a chance , because you gonna be it tiny , tiny little atoms .
i &apos;ll gonna blow you apart , piece by piece , bardo .
it &apos;s mine now .
i &apos;ve heard about this custom-made monster for years .
do not worry , bardo .
i &apos;ll take good care of him .
and i &apos;ll put it to good use .
start with his left hand .
how does it feel to be on the other side , bardo ?
i don &apos;t know .

so , do you have a family back home ? - not anymore .
- but you used to ?
mind if i get a little sleep ?
sorry .
good night .
i had a wife and two kids .
baby girl a boy about kevin &apos;s age .
someone who wanted to hurt me , did it by hurting them .
kevin &apos;s father is dead , too .
he was shot , holding up a liquor store , years ago .
kevin doesn &apos;t even remember him .
he was a gangbanger , brooklyn homeboy .
and at the time i thought homeboy was as cool as you can get .
and then when kevin was born , he swore he was done with gangs , done with crime . but ... he lied .
i don &apos;t know , it &apos;s like in this neighborhood gangs are the only way you can be noticed , the only way you can be somebody .
and they give you a new name , and then you are shorty , or sleepy , or psycho ...
gangs give you an identity .
i didn &apos;t know how hard it is keeping kevin away ... his friends already belonged ...
was trying then i &apos;m gonna lose him if i don &apos;t do something about it .
so why didn &apos;t you leave ?
where ... would i go ?
i don &apos;t have any money , i can &apos;t even pay the rent .
dropped out of school to have kevin .
besides , this is my home .
this is where i grew up , everything i &apos;ve ever known is here . i &apos;m not gonna run away .
you &apos;ve got a lot of guts. lady .
but maybe you &apos;re using the wrong approach .
what do you mean ?
fight fire with fire .
i always thought you fight fire with water ?
some fires are too big .
kevin , leave him alone .
kev , get it and gear , you &apos;re late .
have a good day at school . be careful .
i love you .
bye .
oh , hi .
here is my number at work , in case you need to call .
i don &apos;t think going to work is such a great idea , if those punks are looking for you .
well , if i don &apos;t go to work , i don &apos;t get paid .
if i don &apos;t get paid , i can &apos;t pay the rent .
and there is nothing to eat , so ...
i &apos;m going to work .
i think you should stay in , though .
the world isn &apos;t safe for someone your size .
- look , lady , i &apos;m gonna find the rest of these punks and finish this .
- kevin will be home around 3.30 .
got to do what i got to do , lady .
be careful out there , debi .
so you &apos;re trying to tell me that 13-inch man saved your ass from braxton ? yes .
i thought it was like a hallucination or something that i must ... i mean ...
i don &apos;t know , what i &apos;m gonna do with him .
are you sure it was not a dream ?
i &apos;m serious .
come over tonight and see him for yourself .
i would like to see a 13-inch man ...
you know what i mean ...
i wonder where he came from and what to do ?
what &apos;s so funny , ladies ?
nothing &apos;s funny , sir .
nothing &apos;s funny but thew toxic waste , mr. well , then keep back to wooork !
you &apos;re way too high !
what &apos;s his problem ?
hmm , he asked me out to guns &apos;n&apos;roses concert .
... till i might take that mutants slain from work .
- yeah !
what the fuck are we waiting for ?
we wait because i said we wait .
we can with this bitch .
well , it &apos;s about time .
- oh , fuck !
- yo , i thought that little guy fixed you .
i hope he didn &apos;t go home .
not without his ship .
you know , there does not seem to be much structural damage .
maybe if i just adjust this ... ...
back away , gerald .
i think he suffers from napoleonic syndrome .
- what ?
! short man &apos;s complex .
so ... how long do you think this guy gotta stay with us ?
i don &apos;t know .
his spaceship doesn &apos;t work , so he can &apos;t really go anywhere .
- guess he &apos;s stuck here .
- you want him to stay though , don &apos;t you ?
... ... i heard about this doll-man .
... that he blew away braxton &apos;s red homies last night , es eso cierto ?
yeah , it &apos;s true .

what can you tell me about , uh why you &apos;ve been sent over here ?
well , ahem , i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;s it say there ?
_removed_
well , it , um says several things here .
said you &apos;ve been belligerent talked when unauthorized you &apos;ve been resentful in attitude toward work in general , that you &apos;re lazy .
chewing gum in class .
the real reason you &apos;ve been sent over here is because they wanted you to be evaluated .
- to determine whether or not you &apos;re mentally ill .
why do you think they might think that ?
well , as near as i can figure out , it &apos;s because i , uh .... uh , fight and fuck too much .
in the penitentiary ?
no , no , no , you mean why ...
wait ... why did you get sent over here from the work farm ?
oh . oh , yeah . oh .
uh .... well , i really don &apos;t know , doc .
it says here that you went around ...
- let me just take a look .
_removed_
- you &apos;ve got at least five arrests for assault . - yeah . - what can you tell me about that ?
- five fights , huh ? rocky marciano &apos;s got 40 , and he &apos;s a millionaire .
- that &apos;s true .
of course , it &apos;s true that you went in for statutory rape . that &apos;s true , is it not , this time ?
_removed_
but , doc she was 15 years old going on 35 , doc and , uh , she told me she was 18 , and she was uh , very willing . - i practically had to take to sewing my pants shut .
- mm . mm . but , uh , between you and me , uh she might have been 15 .
when you get that little red beaver right up there in front of you , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s crazy at all .
- and i don &apos;t think you do either . - i hear what you &apos;re saying . no man alive could resist that .
that &apos;s why i got into jail to begin with .
now they &apos;re telling me i &apos;m crazy over here because i don &apos;t sit there like a goddamn vegetable . it don &apos;t make a bit of sense to me .
if that &apos;s what being crazy is then i &apos;m senseless , out of it , gone down the road , wacko .
_removed_
well , to be honest with you , mcmurphy , what it says here is that they think ....
they think you &apos;ve been faking it in order to get out of your work detail .
- what do you think about that ?
- do i look like that kind of guy to you , doc ?
well .... let &apos;s just be frank for a minute , randall , if you would .
tell me do you think there &apos;s anything wrong with your mind , really ?
not a thing , doc . i &apos;m a goddamn marvel of modern science .
well , you &apos;re gonna be here for a period for us to evaluate you .
- we &apos;re gonna study you .
- mm-hm . we &apos;ll make our determinations as to what , uh , we &apos;re going to do and give you the necessary treatment , uh ...
- ... as indicated ... - doc , let me just tell you this .
i &apos;m here to cooperate with you 100 percent . a hundred percent .
i &apos;ll be just right down the line with you . you watch .
because i think we ought to get to the bottom of , uh , r.p. mcmurphy .
the scythe .
- oh . - i &apos;m awfully tired .
- sit down . - i &apos;m tired .
that better ?
mr. ellsworth you &apos;ll wear yourself out . come here .
all right , gentlemen , let &apos;s begin .
at the close of friday &apos;s meeting we were discussing mr. harding &apos;s problem concerning his wife .
mr. harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street .
- is that correct , mr. harding ?
uh , yes .
he also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere , but he wasn &apos;t able to say how .
mr. harding has been heard to say to his wife :
&quot; i hate you . i don &apos;t ever want to see you again .
so does anyone care to touch on this further ?
mr. scanlon , would you begin today ?
are you sure ?
billy , how about you ?
no ... no ... no , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;d like to write in my book that you began the meeting .
just once .
mr. martini ?
are you with us ?
yes .
would you like to begin ?
mr. cheswick ?
- me ?
you mean there &apos;s not a man here who has an opinion on this matter ?
all right . mr. harding you &apos;ve stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men .
oh , yes . yes , very much ... i suspect her .
i suspect her . well , maybe you can tell us why you suspect her .
well , i can only speculate as to the reasons why .
have you ever speculated , mr. harding that perhaps you are impatient with your wife because she doesn &apos;t meet your mental requirements ?
perhaps , but you see , the only thing i can really speculate on , nurse ratched is the very existence of my life , with or without my wife in terms of the human relationships , the juxtaposition of one person to another , the form , the content .
harding , why don &apos;t you knock off the bullshit and get to the point ?
this is the point .
this is the point , taber . it &apos;s not bullshit .
i &apos;m not just talking about my wife , i &apos;m talking about my life .
i can &apos;t seem to get that through to you .
i &apos;m not just talking about one person , i &apos;m talking about everybody . i &apos;m talking about form . i &apos;m talking about content .
i &apos;m talking about interrelationships .
i &apos;m talking about god , the devil , hell , heaven .
- do you understand ?
finally ? - ha ! yeah , harding , you &apos;re so fucking dumb i can &apos;t believe it .
it makes me feel very peculiar , very peculiar ...
_removed_
- peculiar ? - why ?
- what does that mean , peculiar , harding ?
- peculiar ? peculiar ?
- peculiar ?
- ha-ha-ha . - i &apos;m going to tell you guys something .
you just don &apos;t wanna learn anything . you just don &apos;t want to listen to anybody .
he &apos;s got intelligence .
you &apos;ve never heard the word peculiar ?
say , what are you trying to say ?
you trying to say i &apos;m queer ?
is that it ? little mary ann ?
little marjorie jane ? huh ? that it ?
is that what you &apos;re trying to tell me ? is that your idea of communicating something ?
well , is it ?
they &apos;re all crowding in on you , mr. harding .
- they &apos;re all ganging up on you .
- is that news ?
no , they ... they sometimes wanna gang up on me too , but i ...
- cheswick , do me a favor .
- what ? huh ? - take it easy .
- and stay off my side . - but i only wanna ...
i only wanna help you .
- i understand .
- don &apos;t you want me to ... ?
- please .
- but i only wanna ...
- please .
- but i only wanna help you . please !
you see the other day you made some allusions , both of you .
- illusions ? - a sexual ...
yes , allusions . allusions .
not illusions . allusions to sexual problems i might be having with my wife .
all right , say it &apos;s true .
say i know it to be true , but you don &apos;t .
if that &apos;s your idea of trying to tell me something ...
harding , i think you &apos;re some kind of morbid asshole or something .
- peculiar .
- asshole again . it makes you feel peculiar .
you been talking about your wife ever since i can remember .
she &apos;s on your mind . - blah , blah , blah .
- i &apos;m not talking about my wife . when are you gonna get that through your head ?
when are you gonna wise up and turn her loose ? - please . - no , just peculiar .
- i &apos;m tired .

do you think it might be possible to turn that music down so maybe a couple of the boys could talk ?
that music is for everyone , mr. mcmurphy .
i know , but do you think we might ease it down a little bit so maybe the boys didn &apos;t have to shout ? huh ?
what you probably don &apos;t realize is that we have a lot of old men on this ward who couldn &apos;t hear the music if we turned it lower .
that music is all they have . your hand is staining my window .
i &apos;m sorry , ma &apos;am .
really sorry .
- mr. mcmurphy , your medication .
- huh ? - what &apos;s in the horse pill ?
- it &apos;s just medicine .
it &apos;s good for you . yeah , but i don &apos;t like the idea of taking something if i don &apos;t know what it is .
- don &apos;t get upset , mr. mcmurphy . - i &apos;m not getting upset , miss pilbow .
it &apos;s just that i don &apos;t want anyone to try and slip me saltpeter . you know what i mean ?
it &apos;s all right , nurse pilbow .
if mr. mcmurphy doesn &apos;t want to take his medication orally i &apos;m sure we can arrange that he can have it some other way .

mr. mcmurphy ?
yeah , i &apos;ve been thinking about what you said about , uh you know , getting things off your chest .
and , uh .... uh , ahem . well , there &apos;s a couple of things that i &apos;d like to get off my chest .
well , that &apos;s very good , mr. mcmurphy .
okay . today , as you may or may not know ... it doesn &apos;t matter .
what i &apos;d like to suggest is that we change the work detail tonight so that we can watch the ball game .
well , mr. mcmurphy , what you &apos;re asking is that we change a very carefully worked-out schedule .
a little change never hurt , huh ? a little variety ?
well , it &apos;s not necessarily true , mr. mcmurphy .
some men on the ward take a long , long time to get used to the schedule .
change it now , and they might find it very disturbing .
ah , fuck the schedule .
they can go back to the schedule after the series .
i &apos;m talking about the world series , nurse ratched .

how would it be if we had a vote and let majority rule ?

don &apos;t you wanna watch the world series ?

i haven &apos;t missed the series in years .
even in the cooler .
when i &apos;m in the cooler , they run it there or they have a riot .
what &apos;s the matter with you guys ?
well , mr. mcmurphy , i only count three votes and that &apos;s not enough to change ward policy .
i &apos;m sorry .

cigarettes are not important . sit down , will you ? for chrissake .

remember , mr. scanlon , we &apos;ve discussed many times that time spent in the company of others is very therapeutic while time spent brooding alone only increases a feeling of separation .

i want an answer to my question . did he leave the grounds of the hospital ?

i don &apos;t have to tell her ?
your mother and i are old friends . you know that .
um .... please do ...

and the bets are placed . there &apos;s one for tabes and chessy and martini and the dealer .
and a four to tabes , and a six and a nine ...
- ... and a 10 to the dealer .
what do you say , tabes ? a dime apiece . no ?
you stick . - he sticks . - sticks with a four .
chessy &apos;s going for the ride . - what does that mean ?
- he wants a hit . he wants a hit . and a big queen .
i think you &apos;re busted . buggered , not busted . - turn them over .
- buggered . and weep .
- hit me .
i think you &apos;re over . i know you &apos;re over . that &apos;s a three .
mr. sefelt ? did everything go well ?
that &apos;s very nice . now you feel better , don &apos;t you ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
mcmurphy is out .
mcmurphy has escaped .
they were taking him through the tunnel . he beat up two of the attendants and escaped .
- mcmurphy &apos;s upstairs . - oh , no , no , no .
jim , i &apos;m telling you , mcmurphy is upstairs and he &apos;s as meek as a lamb .
really ? i mean , how do you know ?
- jack dunphy told me .
- jack dunphy &apos;s full of shit . - ha . - right .
mac .
they said you escaped . i knew you wouldn &apos;t leave without me .
i was waiting for you . now we can make it , mac .
i feel big as a damn mountain .
i &apos;m not going without you , mac . i wouldn &apos;t leave you here this way .
you &apos;re coming with me .

doctor :
you should prepare yourself .
john , i &apos;m so glad you &apos;ve come .
here i am , father .
the law prevents me from dividing up my estate .
you are to have everything .
without your help , your stepmother and the girls will have almost nothing .
you must do something .
you must promise me .
you must give me your solemn promise .
yes , of course .
fanny : norland park , ours at last .
come to bed .
i promised father i would do something for them .
you are the most generous of men .
- i hope you don &apos;t intend to spoil them .
- not to spoil them .
i have written to mary saying that they may expect us on monday .
blow out the candle , dear .
monday ?
_removed_
- have they no heart at all ?
- it is their house now , marianne .
- but why , elinor ?
it isn &apos;t fair , is it ?
_removed_
mr john dashwood is father &apos;s only son and sons are always heirs .
there &apos;s nothing anyone can do about it .
how can you be so calm about it ?
oh , mother , don &apos;t cry , dear .
but what will we do ?
will we have to live with gypsies ? i &apos;d rather live with the gypsies than share a roof with aunt fanny .
she &apos;s an insufferable woman . if she comes to live here , i might even poison her .
i thought of giving the girls £ 1,000 a piece .
- would that be fair , do you think ?
- a thousand a piece , are you mad ?
would you rob your only child of his rightful inheritance ?
henry , your father proposes to steal £ 3,000 from you and give it to his half-sisters .
you think it too generous .
- five hundred a piece ? - oh .
that would be beyond anything generous , when you think that they will have 3,000 on their mother &apos;s death .
a very comfortable fortune for any young woman ,
i should have thought .
your papa is set on robbing you , henry .
perhaps the matter does require further thought .
mama , they won &apos;t expect you to give up your own bedroom .
it is their house now .
of course they will expect the best it has to offer . mama , our brother has a kind heart .
he wouldn &apos;t want you to be uncomfortable .
he promised papa he would look after us all .
yes , yes , he did .
and he will .
i &apos;m sure of it .
to say the truth , i &apos;m convinced your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all .
what would they spend it on ?
they &apos;ll have no carriage , no horses , hardly any servants .
i suppose ... - and consider , my dear , you owe no particular gratitude to your father , nor attention to his wishes .
for we very well know that , if he could , he would have left almost everything in the world to them .
upon my word , i do believe you &apos;re right .
my father must have meant nothing more than what you said .
just a general concern for their welfare , occasional presents of fish and game and so forth .
exactly .
there , there , darling . we shan &apos;t let the poor starve .
i shan &apos;t speak to them when they come in .
yes , you will . we shall all be on our best behaviour .
because we are the visitors now .
oh , really , mary .
well , here we are at last .
after you , my dear , of course .
so , elinor , still at your music ?
marianne still sketching away ?
you see , i remember everything .
- other way round , aunt . - marianne is the musician .
oh , yes . - and what about you , margaret ?
_removed_
a writer .
well , pens and paper cost very little .
you have made a sensible choice .
this is an elegant dinner service . of course , you will have no use for it when you move to a smaller place .
- my dear ...
- and , of course , it belongs here .
- belongs to the house .
- and the house belongs to you .
though you neither care for it , nor need it , nor deserve it .
you know you really can &apos;t say things like that at the dinner table , to their faces .
well , it &apos;s true .
she cares nothing for norland . only for the pounds , shillings and pence it &apos;s worth .
and it &apos;s quite clear our brother has no intention of honouring his promise to papa .
- i know , but ...
- my dears . mr gridley has found us two very suitable houses .
beacham court and thrush place .
i favour beacham court .
look , marianne , it has a gazebo .
and the grounds are very manageable , i should think .
mama , they &apos;re both far beyond our income .
well , they &apos;re both smaller than norland , elinor .
mama , we need to think very differently now .
we could hardly afford the gate house at beacham court .
i suppose you would have us live in a rabbit hutch .
not quite , mama .
a cottage would answer very well . sometimes , elinor , i think you don &apos;t understand how i feel .
i do , mama .
truly i do . but we have to be practical .
oh , here you all are .
i wondered where you were all hiding .
i have just heard from my brother edward .
he is coming to stay and we expect his visit to be a long one , so we are very favoured .
_removed_
_removed_
as the eldest son , he will of course inherit a considerable fortune , and we expect great things of him .
_removed_
so much to do before he arrives .
he has a very discerning eye and i shouldn &apos;t want him to find fault with anything .
_removed_
i bet he &apos;s just like her .
( servants muttering ) elinor :
martha , what are you doing ?
didn &apos;t you do them a week ago ?
mrs john dashwood &apos;s orders , miss . they &apos;re all to be done again with the gentleman coming .
those carpets are clean .
thank you , miss elinor .
- good morning .
- oh , i was just ...
beating carpets .
- yes .
- edward ferrars , how do you do ? my horse has thrown a shoe , so i came by the way of the stables .
elinor dashwood .
would you like some help with the carpet beating ?
no . i &apos;d better take you in to see your sister .
edward , the state of you .
where are your things ? they &apos;re sending them on from the inn .
i felt like a ride , so i borrowed a horse .
- how long are you going to stay ?
- mrs dashwood : margaret . i am entirely dependent on mrs dashwood , of course .
i wouldn &apos;t want to overstay my welcome .
i shall have you shown to your room immediately .
what on earth possessed you to arrive here looking like a country bumpkin ?
my dear fanny , we are in the country after all .
i think the first thing to do is rip out all these dingy old panelings .
so dark and dusty , i &apos;m sure you will agree .
and all these old books ! how could a gentleman bear to sit in a gloomy old den like this ?
oh , elinor .
well , do not let us disturb you .
- here , will you take this ?
- fanny .
- yes , edward ?
this is a library , a place of refuge .
libraries should be full of dusty old books and nooks and corners and places to hide away in .
i do believe this library is quite perfect just as it is .
edward , you know you only say these things to annoy me .
i &apos;m afraid it must pain you to see my sister refurbishing norland after her own taste .
it is her house now .
she must do as she sees fit , i suppose . she &apos;s doing her level best to refurbish me , too .
i &apos;m a grave disappointment to my family , miss dashwood .
fanny would like me to be a great man of some sort .
important , talked about , riding around in a barouche .
and you don &apos;t see yourself in a barouche ?
a pony and trap would do me very well . i want to go into the church , you see ?
quiet country parish .
i think we all have to find our own ways to be happy .
so do i. and i think i prefer your notion of happiness .
do you ?
good . quiet country parish it is then .
this must be a very hard time for you , your father &apos;s death .
my own father died when i was 17 .
i was like a boat that had lost its anchor .
we must all have someone to listen to us , to understand what we feel .
elinor !
- it &apos;s not fair .
- what &apos;s not fair ? henry &apos;s got my pony .
nobody asked me if he could ride him .
- and he &apos;s pulling his mouth .
- meg , he doesn &apos;t mean any harm .
_removed_
it is a matter of principle . you are quite right .
i will speak to my sister about it . meanwhile , how about setting your sights a bit higher than a pony ?
- mmm ? i don &apos;t think i can bear it in this house for much longer .
i don &apos;t care where we go , but we must leave as soon as possible .
i don &apos;t think we should leave norland until we see how things stand between elinor and edward .
mrs dashwood : can you see ?
they &apos;ve formed an attachment .
oh , mama .
- how shall we do without her ?
- oh , my love .
it &apos;ll scarcely be a separation . we shall take a house within a few miles of them .
_removed_
you will gain a brother , a real affectionate brother .
edward is very amiable , but for me there is something wanting .
mama , i am not sure that he really loves poetry , and i am sure he only praises elinor &apos;s drawings because they &apos;re hers .
but i require so much . i think i shall never see a man that i can really and truly love .
my dear , you &apos;re not yet 17 .
i think very highly of him .
- i like him , marianne .
- but is he worthy of you ? he has no taste for drawing or music or anything of that kind .
there are worse faults than failing to appreciate your music .
but his reading last evening , so calm and spiritless .
he has a different style from yours .
_removed_
well , when you tell me to love him as my brother-in-law ,
i promise i &apos;ll think him as perfect as you do .
marianne , there is no question of that .
not yet . he has family duties .
he has obligations .
what obligations ?
- i don &apos;t know .
- if he loves you , he will act upon his feelings whatever his family might say .
marianne , stop .
nothing has been said between us .
i do have feelings for him , and i believe he returns them .
but , please , don &apos;t hope for something that may never happen .
then you &apos;re not engaged ? - i was sure that you were in secret .
- no . well , i &apos;m sure it will happen very soon .
and so am i .
margaret ! get down from there this minute .
stay a moment if you would , mary .
i just wanted to give you a little hint about my brother edward .
i think he is enjoying his visit , fanny .
you must know that my mother , mrs ferrars , has very high hopes of him .
- i &apos;m sure he will fulfil them .
- both in terms of his career and his marriage .
he will be expected to marry a young lady either of high rank or great fortune , preferably both .
i see . his happiness will depend upon our mother &apos;s wishes .
if he goes against her , he will get nothing .
so you see , any young woman who tries to draw him in , will find herself gravely disappointed .
just a little hint , mary .
thank you , fanny .
mama , mama !
it &apos;s from sir john middleton , a cousin of mine .
he has offered us a cottage on his estate .
sir john is so genteel and accommodating and he writes in such a warm and friendly style .
- what do you think , elinor ?
- the cottage is small and the rent is very moderate .
we shall probably need only two servants .
i think we should consider it , mama .
i shall write and accept sir john &apos;s offer immediately .
_removed_
a cottage in devonshire .
you will be very cosy .
devonshire is a long way away . not too far for our true friends to visit us , mr ferrars .
i hope we shall be able to welcome you at barton cottage very soon .
thank you , mrs dashwood .
upon my word , i quite envy you .
then you should go live there , aunt fanny , and we will stay here at norland .
( marianne coughing )
sir john middleton must be very well set up to be able to offer you hospitality at so low a rent , mary .
he says he saw the opportunity to do a good turn and was glad to take it .
ah , i was , um ...
excuse me , edward .
i must just ask mama something .
surely you &apos;ll be very sorry to leave norland .
of course . - but in the circumstances ...
- yes .
these last few weeks have been very happy ones for me .
in fact , i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever been happier .
i &apos;m very glad to have been able to offer you friendship at this difficult time .
and i want you
to know that i very much value your friendship , too .
well , goodbye , mary .
edward , promise you &apos;ll come and see us soon .
well , my dear ?
i have no news for you , mama .
we shall see him again very soon .
oh , mama , look !
it &apos;s the sea . and do you think that &apos;s the cottage ?
oh , mama , how romantic .
we should have thought to send thomas and alice on ahead of us .
with a fire in every room it will soon be cheerful .
who is to light the fires ?
well ...
can we really settle here , do you think ?
of course we can .
- mama , there &apos;s someone coming !
- oh , good heavens !
so , cousin mary , pleasure to meet you at last .
there we are , just a little something for your larder .
welcome to devonshire .
i cannot thank you enough for your kindness , sir john .
no , no , no , none of that . i &apos;m delighted to have you here .
i like nothing so much as company . i saw you drive past the house .
you should have come in .
- so , these are your girls .
- yes . well , well , well .
how are you , my dears ?
this is my eldest , elinor , and marianne , and my youngest , margaret .
_removed_
very pleased to welcome three such pretty girls . i dare say we &apos;ll find you all husbands before the year &apos;s out .
- uh ... - um ...
why , whatever &apos;s the matter ? what did i say ? my youngest sister is perhaps a little young for a husband , sir .
is she ? yes , i suppose she is .
i know nothing of these matters .
i leave it to the women . my mother-in-law , mrs jennings , is a great authority on these matters .
and you will meet her by and by , because i insist that you dine at barton park today and every day
- until you are properly settled . - oh , that is too ...
i insist , i absolutely insist .
and my dear wife wouldn &apos;t hear of anything else .
company , company , where would we be without company ? i will send the carriage for you at four o &apos;clock sharp .
my dear , have you ever seen such pretty girls ?
indeed .
ah , here &apos;s my mother-in-law .
what kept you so long , madam ?
_removed_
wicked man . oh , my looking glass days are over these many years .
well , now .
we must see what we can do for them , eh , mrs jennings ?
lovers , husbands , that sort of thing , what !
well , how do we know they haven &apos;t left their hearts behind in sussex , eh ?
- elinor has . - meg . ah , now we come to it .
i thought i saw a little blush .
no , really .
consider nothing settled .
for a certain gentleman is coming to stay with us who may make you forget all your fancies .
what do you say , sir john ?
colonel brandon . yes , indeed .
a military hero .
served in the east indies .
they say he had his heart broken and he has never looked at a woman since .
not in that sort of way , you know .
but when he sees the miss dashwoods ,
i think we may find he has to change his mind . i think he may .
i think he may .
_removed_
i like that .
that is as it should be . for myself , when i fall in love , it will be forever .
very proper , very romantic .
_removed_
colonel brandon is arrived . - bring him in , jenkins .
sir john :
come in , dear friend .
we were just speaking of you .
i &apos;m not intruding ? not a bit of it , you couldn &apos;t have arrived at a better time .
lady middleton .
mrs jennings .
- naughty man to keep away so long .
- i had some necessary business .
mrs dashwood .
miss dashwood .
miss marianne dashwood .
- miss margaret dashwood .
- honoured to make your acquaintance .
now , what do you say , mrs dashwood ?
first class .
well done , indeed .
what do you think , brandon ?
yes , um , remarkable .
margaret : may i play now , mama ? of course , my dear .
your sister plays with extraordinary feeling for one so young .
she would be grateful for your good opinion , i &apos;m sure . i once knew a young woman who played with that intensity of feeling .
but i think your sister has a surer technique .
i would be glad to pass on your compliments , but why should you not tell her yourself ?
we were talking about your performance , marianne .
oh .
- remarkable .
- yes , so you said . i cannot tell whether that means you approve it or not .
i noticed you played the last movement appassionato ,
miss dashwood , and i believe the composer marked it allegro .
and you disapprove of that ?
no , not at all .
i found it ... original .
_removed_
if we are to dine at barton park every night , we &apos;ll be paying a heavy price for sir john &apos;s generosity .
marianne , that &apos;s unkind .
sir john is all affability and mrs jennings seems delighted to have our company .
elinor , how could you bear their relentless vulgar teasing ?
i was embarrassed , but they meant no harm .
and lady middleton &apos;s so cold and insipid .
and they all pretended to like music though none of them listened to it , nor cared for it !
colonel brandon listened with great attention .
yes , and found fault with my playing . i think colonel brandon has a little more discernment than your usual audience .
i think he &apos;s the sort of man that likes to find fault with everybody and everything .
mama , it &apos;s that man !
meg !
meg . colonel brandon , ma &apos;am .
i had occasion to ride over to my home in delaford earlier this morning .
i took the liberty of bringing you these flowers , mrs dashwood .
oh . well , thank you .
they &apos;re beautiful .
and i looked out some music which i thought might be of interest to miss marianne .
i think you overestimate my abilities , sir .
i think not . - you have an instrument here ?
- yes , of sorts .
well , i have a very fine pianoforte at delaford that deserves to be played on more often .
_removed_
won &apos;t you sit down ?
take some refreshment , colonel . thank you , no .
i shan &apos;t intrude on you any longer . i &apos;m sure i shall have the pleasure of seeing you all soon at barton park .
well , miss marianne has made a conquest of brandon , there &apos;s no doubt of that .
who &apos;d have thought it ?
i was near to despairing of him .
_removed_
marianne is very young .
seventeen is a little too soon to be thinking of marriage .
not a bit of it , my dear .
i was married at 16 , myself .
sooner the better , i say . she &apos;ll bear him some fine big sons .
what do you say , miss elinor ?
your sister &apos;s stolen a march on you . i hope you didn &apos;t have designs on the colonel yourself .
has the colonel spoken to you about his feelings for my sister ?
well , not in so many words , but you can &apos;t mistake it .
the man &apos;s besotted with her .
he &apos;d be a fine catch for any girl , if she could get him .
and is this what everybody thinks ?
how mortifying !
elinor ?
- you like him , marianne .
_removed_
but because he is the only person in the neighbourhood with whom one can have an intelligent conversation .
i never thought he meant ...
elinor , he &apos;s too old ! he is 35 , marianne .
five years younger than i am , and i never thought of myself as being quite decrepit .
that &apos;s unfair , mama , you know i never meant that .
most people , i think , would still consider colonel brandon a young man .
no one &apos;s forcing him upon you , my dear , but men of 35 have married girls of 17 before , i believe .
you do both realise it will be impossible for me to speak to him again .
except in company .
marianne !
come on , meg , out back .
- what for ?
_removed_
- really !
- come on , meg .
- but i don &apos;t want to go for a walk .
- yes , you do .
it &apos;s about colonel brandon , isn &apos;t it ?
don &apos;t you like him any more ? i simply felt in urgent need of fresh air and exercise .
i think it &apos;s going to rain .
is there a felicity in the world superior to this ?
margaret , we will walk here at least two hours .
- i told you it would rain .
- what of it ? sweet , refreshing rain .
_removed_
_removed_
# the wind and the rain !
well , my compliments to miss marianne and miss margaret .
marianne will be so sorry to have missed you , colonel brandon .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;d want to thank you for the books .
it &apos;s so thoughtful of you . oh , not at all .
well , good day , mrs dashwood , miss dashwood .
won &apos;t you wait till the rain has stopped ? no . i fear i &apos;ve outstayed my welcome already .
i don &apos;t like this , marianne , and i &apos;m all wet !
- this has all been a very silly idea . - nonsense ! a little rain never hurt anybody .
come on , let &apos;s ... ( marianne screaming )
are you hurt ? don &apos;t move .
- where are you injured ?
- my ankle .
you will permit me ? i know a little about these things .
no bones broken .
but it &apos;s a bad sprain .
you mustn &apos;t walk on it . be so good as to put your arm around my neck .
( exclaims )
mama , elinor !
mama , elinor !
mama , we were running down the hill .
marianne fell and hurt herself and now a man is carrying her .
don &apos;t be alarmed , i beg you , madam .
her injuries are minor .
a sprained ankle and some bruising only .
- there .
forgive the intrusion , madam , i couldn &apos;t think how else to manage it .
i happened to be passing . i saw her fall .
clearly she was unable to stand or walk and ... so here we are .
she &apos;ll need to rest the ankle for a few days
- but she should recover very soon .
- excuse me .
oh , um , will you not sit down for a moment , sir ?
- warm yourself by the fire .
- no , thank you , madam .
i won &apos;t intrude any longer . perhaps you will allow me to return tomorrow to see how your daughter ...
- your daughter ...
- oh , my younger daughter , marianne .
to see how your daughter marianne is progressing . this is so kind of you , sir .
may we know your name ?
my name is willoughby , ma &apos;am . willoughby of allenham .
until tomorrow then .
thank you again , mr willoughby .
well .
willoughby . willoughby of allenham .
it &apos;s a good name , isn &apos;t it , elinor ?
it has a poetic ring .
willoughby of allenham .
he was very handsome , wasn &apos;t he , marianne ?
he has a true natural grace and strength .
he picked me up and carried me as if i were no more than a feather . and you put your arm right around his neck .
i saw you .
_removed_
truly good manners have nothing to do with convention .
i thought mr willoughby &apos;s manners were impeccable .
- and such a sweet smile . - did you remark his eyes , mama ?
- mmm-hmm .
( mrs dashwood chuckling )
willoughby .
willoughby of allenham . willoughby of allenham has left some very muddy footprints in the passage .
_removed_
is he in the country ?
i &apos;ll ride over and invite him to dinner on thursday .
- do you know him , then ?
- know him ? very well .
what kind of a man is he ?
well , he &apos;s as good a kind of fellow who &apos;s ever lived .
he &apos;s a very decent shot and there &apos;s no bolder rider in england .
but what is he like ?
upon my soul , i don &apos;t know much about him as to all that .
he &apos;s a pleasant , cheerful fellow , and he has the prettiest little pointer bitch i &apos;ve ever seen .
- was he out with her today ?
well , there you are , then .
- is he married , sir john ?
_removed_
i see where this is leading .
no , he is not married .
he comes down to visit the old lady at allenham court , and he will inherit there .
he also has a pretty little estate of his own in somersetshire .
i see how it will be . you will set your cap at him now , never think of poor brandon .
he &apos;s coming ! willoughby &apos;s coming !
quickly !
- quickly , quickly .
- and how is the invalid this morning ?
- pretty well , i thank you .
- thanks to you , mr willoughby . - not at all .
i count myself lucky to have been passing at the time . i was up early this morning .
i picked these wild strawberries for you .
wild strawberries !
i love wild strawberries .
i thought you might .
- shall i ?
- thank you .
- thank you . we have been hearing all about you , mr willoughby .
sir john says that you &apos;re very fond of dancing .
indeed i am , and hope to have the pleasure of proving it to you all before long when miss marianne &apos;s ankle is fully recovered .
- do you care for poetry , too ?
- oh , very much .
ah , i see you &apos;re reading pope .
- are you fond of pope ?
- no .
my sentiments exactly . he &apos;s too rational for me .
more to be admired than loved .
that is just what i think .
- do you know lord byron ?
- no , i have heard of him .
&quot; so we &apos;ll go no more a-roving so late into the night
&quot; though my heart be still as loving the moon be still as bright &quot;
- he is a true romantic .
- that is just the sort of thing i like .
isn &apos;t it extraordinary , mama , that it should &apos;ve been mr willoughby who was passing when i fell down the hill ?
- mmm . - yes .
it might have been some uncouth old farmer who &apos;d never read a word of byron in his life .
( knocking at door )
- oh , who could that be ?
i ... i heard of your accident .
i trust you are not seriously injured .
no , not at all . no , i see that you are not .
thank god for that . colonel brandon , do you know mr willoughby ?
- yes , how do you do , sir ?
well , having ascertained that miss marianne is on the mend ,
i will intrude no longer .

- how &apos;d you know i was here ? .
- oh , i just took a chance .
the report , norman . the report . i can &apos;t read the name of the detective .
you went back to get the report ? . claude , look .
you told me you weren &apos;t interested .
i-
- i &apos;m not .
but , uh- - you know , a lot of people make an absolute killing in celebrity garbage .
well , mr. keller ... the only assistance i need is for you to give me ... any other copies of the report , so that i can destroy them ... as i did the one you gave mr. robbins .
- you destroyed the report ? .
- yes . oh , yes .
y-you did read it ? .
i don &apos;t know what sort of people you &apos;re used to dealing with here ... but i-i do not have ... a suspicious bone in my body .
you don &apos;t know about the man leaving your apartment at 1 : 30 ? .
a man left my apartment at 1 : 30 ? .
what &apos;s so unusual about that ? .
1 : 30 in the morning ? .
maybe it was a repairman . i mean , uh--
god ! uh , things break at night , don &apos;t they ? .
- mr. eastman , let me be honest with you .
- no .
in my business , the only thing that gets broken in the middle of the night ... are the hearts of older men like us .
it &apos;s downright tragic .
we fall for these beautiful , young things ... and we try to believe they &apos;re in love with us ... when every morning , our shaving mirror yells , &quot; they can &apos;t be . &quot;
if i could just have the other reports , it &apos;d be fine .
oh . oh .
very wise .
i only wish i &apos;d been so wise .
- - you know , mr. eastman , if i had it to do over again ...
i wouldn &apos;t try to find out anything .
i &apos;d just be grateful for whatever she was willing to give me .
a year . a week .
an hour-- oh ! here we are .
actually , there was not much need at all to hire me in the first place ... what with that fancy surveillance system you have in your building .
anybody steps into the hallway , it automatically turns on the videotape .
wait a minute . are you saying there &apos;s a tape of a man leaving my apartment ? .
_removed_
_removed_
don &apos;t you worry , mr. eastman .
i &apos;ll erase the tape , and you destroy the report ... and as far as the two of us are concerned , it never happened .
well , that &apos;s really very reassuring . thank you very much .
i certainly hope that you &apos;re continuing that haydn series next season .
yes , we are . yes . it was very successful .
- that makes me very happy .
- yeah .
um , was there-- is there an outstanding account at all ?
no , no , no ! mr. robbins took care of everything .
- that includes the-- the tape .
- oh , including the tape .
yes . good . well , we &apos;re all settled then .
thanks very much .
good-bye .
whenever you &apos;re ready , mr. eastman .
- you knew .
- uh-huh .
i knew it . that &apos;s nothing !
that &apos;s giuseppe . that &apos;s the man who works for me .
no , no , no . that was at 8 : 30 .
look at the printout .
any movement in the hallway starts the tape machine automatically .
- there he is . -
i can &apos;t see who it is . is that all you have ?
_removed_
it &apos;s not my equipment that screwed up . your building &apos;s tape machine--
- god !

what ? .
well , at least you know it &apos;s a guy who wears argyle socks .
who wears argyle socks ? .

i said you seemed very-- oh , my god .
- what ? .
- don &apos;t look . there &apos;s a woman-- don &apos;t look ! don &apos;t--
wait . there &apos;s a woman at the bar in blue .
i &apos;ve never seen a body like that . look very carefully . now .
oh , geez . oh , my goodness .
- look at the body-- -
- i had no idea you had such a roving eye .
- i don &apos;t have a roving eye .
if a woman like that walks into your field of vision , you look at her-- come on .
i &apos; m not a saint , claude .
- - what are you doing ? .
- i dropped my fork . - no , you didn &apos;t .
you held it over and threw it down there .

well , we didn &apos;t know what we were gonna do either .
anyway , don &apos;t worry about it . max is handling it right now .

. - come on , will ya ? .
you were no stranger to married women before you and daniella got together .
- don &apos;t put me into the category--
- yeah , but they weren &apos;t married to friends !
i know . due to extenuating circumstances . that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to tell you .
the only thing extenuating is your pecker , which arises automatically ... in the presence of the nearest female flesh !
- i don &apos;t blame you for being upset .
- oh , thank you .
- i &apos;m glad you &apos;re so understanding .
- i didn &apos;t start it .
are you trying to tell me she started it ? .
it isn &apos;t important who started it . it just happened .
- excuse me .

you went to bed because you don &apos;t know how to play gin rummy ? .
- no ! no . i went to bed because it was 1 : 00 in the morning .
i was tired . i fell asleep .
you did it while you were asleep ? .

&quot; een and out &quot; ? .
&quot; een and out &quot; ? .
well , that &apos;s what happened ! i &apos;m sorry .
i mean , uh-- i shouldn &apos;t have been so generous !
generosity ?
. godda-- is that what you call it in italy ? .
yes , that &apos;s what we call it . what do you call it in-- in new york ? .
in new york , we ca--
we call it shameful .
we call it disgusting , immoral and unforgivable !

you spend two hours in that tank !

yeah . don &apos;t you understand ? .
that cheating , conniving woman has given me more happiness than i &apos;ve ever known .
who is it ? . just initials . give me one--
- norman ! it &apos;s not important .
- give me one initial .
for me , it does not exist .
that &apos;s an admirable quality . i don &apos;t think i have that quality .
you don &apos;t .
i &apos;m a middle-aged man married to a child .
i should be grateful for anytime she &apos;s willing to give me .
a year , a week , an hour .
if you &apos;d be good enough to give me a lift uptown ...

is it still the file room ?
pizza today , right ?
in the cafeteria ?
or is it meat loaf ?
no , i &apos;m saying that you and i both agree
that the file room
minus one file
is still the file room .
now , say you took another one out
and then another .
if the file room minus one file
is still a file room ,
and you keep subtracting one at a time ,
you could end up with zero files ...
i &apos;m saying , logically- or even negative files ,
and it would still ... how do you have negative files ?
no , i &apos;m just ...
_removed_
except no one &apos;s taking files .
they just bring more .
what about a cemetery ?
i mean , remove one body from a cemetery ,

uh , quiet now . come on in here , all of you .
we &apos;re doing good .
i &apos;m up .
i &apos;m sorry .
i was just saying we &apos;re doing good , you know ?
but it was here , inspector .
wasn &apos;t it , johnny ?
we got everything we need .
that &apos;s preposterous .
no one would dare commit a murder
in this hotel without first notifying me . are you sure you weren &apos;t seeing things ?
no , of course he wasn &apos;t seeing things .
well , i &apos;m going to sleep .
just as i told you , inspector .

there &apos;s always a murder . &quot;
_removed_
oh , it &apos;s jeff , the night porter .

check your wallets , ladies and gentlemen .
make sure he didn &apos;t make those vanish too .
well , it &apos;s been a big year
for insurance ...
a banner year .
reserve trends are up .
and ...
loss ratios are down a whopping 17 % .
and those are just numbers .
we all know that behind every insurance policy
and the reinsurance policy covering that policy ...
there &apos;s a salesman .
a man or woman
knocking on doors , making calls ,
matching people and businesses
with the right plan for their needs .
and so without further delay ,
i give you insurance salesman of the year 2007 :
lester nygaard .
boy .
_removed_
thank you .
thank you so much .
_removed_
thank you so much .
_removed_
oh , jeez .
that &apos;s a real honor .
_removed_
see , i knew i should have memorized this .
suddenly doesn &apos;t ...
speak from the heart .
_removed_
those of you that know me
know it &apos;s been a tough year for me personally ...
and that i wouldn &apos;t have gotten through it
without the love and support
of my beautiful wife , linda .
let &apos;s give her a hand .
i love you , linda .
you know , you can go through your whole life
without a care ,
and one day it all changes .
people die .
they lose their homes .
they go to prison .
it &apos;s calamity , huh ?
i know it , &apos; cause i lived it .
and if this year has taught me anything ...
and believe me , i &apos;ve seen it all ...
it &apos;s that the worst does happen .
and you need to be insured .
thank you so much .
_removed_
so proud of ya , lester .
oh , thanks , hon .
you tired ?
oh , aren &apos;t you ?
_removed_

you want me to go ...
_removed_
_removed_

i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m such a downer .
you &apos;re a sunny day .
_removed_
_removed_
big night , huh ?
salesman of the year . oh .
drugs ?
insurance .
they really give an award
to the guy who sells the most drugs ?
pharmaceuticals .
oh , that makes more sense . yeah .
so what are you drinking ?
something dangerous .
_removed_
uh , oh , a blood and sand .
_removed_
scotch and blood orange .
that &apos;s the one .
all right .
i sit down and ... oh , miss ,
can we have some more sparkling water ?
thanks .
um , anyways ...
so i say , &quot; hi , i &apos;m dr . michaelson .
nice to meet you , &quot; and everything .
and i get ready to give him the novocaine shot .

i can see the heat !
- temple !
- sandy , over here .
do people live here ?
the wolf is growling and the man with the shotgun says to illya kuryakin ,
&quot; would you like for me to open the gate ? &quot;
i &apos;m sorry , temple , you lost me .
the man from u.n.c.l.e. the gazebo in the maze .
the wolf is growling and the man with the shotgun says to illya kuryakin ,
&quot; would you like for me to open the gate ? &quot;
&quot; would you like for me to open the gate ? &quot;
you okay ?
- aunt ann , what is this place ?
- just holding pens .
you don &apos;t have those on the east coast , huh ?

yes , it is .
&quot; would you like for me to open the gate ? &quot;
&quot; would you like for me to open the gate ? &quot;

temple made it okay .
- say hi to your uncle mike .
- hi , temple .
i just been telling billy here all about our summer visitor .

hello , i &apos;m temple . it &apos;s very nice to meet you .
nice to meet you , too .
ma &apos;am .

let me show you your room .

and i put all my science fiction books there .
- how do i know this is my room ?
- because we say so . it &apos;s your room .
okay ?
okay .
so , temple , you excited about college ?
that &apos;s something .
- thank you . - i can &apos;t eat that .
i have colitis . i get it from nervousness .
- i eat pudding and jell-o . - i know .
your mom said .
so you didn &apos;t answer mike &apos;s question .
are you excited about going to college ?
i want to stay in high school . i like my science teacher .
dr. carlock &apos;s very smart and he &apos;s been to college .
so i don &apos;t understand why i have to move to learn what he probably already knows .
the dessert spoons and teaspoons go in different sections .
i did that .
you know , your uncle can &apos;t tell them apart .
and sometimes i can &apos;t either .
they &apos;re different .
yes , they are .
i think it &apos;s time for bed , young lady .
we get up with the rooster around here .
- you got everything ?
- this is my room .
yes , it is .
- so , good night . - i don &apos;t want you to do that .
i &apos;m sorry . i forgot . no hugs .
good night then .
- hello ?
- did i wake you ?
- of course not . - who is it ?
it &apos;s ann !
guess what i found balled up in the bottom of temple &apos;s closet ?
a lovely summer frock she didn &apos;t want ?
it &apos;s taken me an age to iron it . i &apos;ll mail it in the morning .
if you couldn &apos;t get her to pack it , i &apos;m not sure i can get her to wear it .
the other one came off the minute she arrived .
how is she ?
- she &apos;s good . - tell me .
she ...
she got tense when mike mentioned college , but ...
no , but then she calmed down and she went off to bed just fine .
stop worrying . temple &apos;s my job for the summer .
worry about the others .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;s gonna have a great time .
you do remember , though , something &apos;s gonna set her off .
temple ?
temple !
temple , i could really use a hand here !
so any idea what your major might be ?
science , probably psychology .
well , you don &apos;t have to decide just yet , do you ?
- it &apos;s better than boarding school . - that &apos;s great .
- lots of choices ...
- danny &apos;s looking at you .
see ?
he can see all around without moving his head .
- so how do you know where he &apos;s looking ?
- his ears . he points his ears where he &apos;s looking .
see ? he &apos;s looking at you .
and he &apos;s looking at those cowboys .
see ?
now i &apos;ve got his attention . now he &apos;s looking at me .
you &apos;re right . how &apos;d you figure that out ?
- there you go !
- what are they doing ?
what is this thing ?
it holds her still so billy can inoculate her .
what happened to it ?
it calmed down .
they just like it . it gentles them .
stand still and they &apos;ll come to you .
won &apos;t harm you . just curious .
can &apos;t help themselves .
are you worried about keeping up with the other students ?
- no . i &apos;m not stupid . - i didn &apos;t say you were .
- is it moving away from home ?
_removed_
why don &apos;t you want to go to college ?
people .
i don &apos;t understand people .
at least the people at school know i don &apos;t understand them
- and some of them are my friends anyway .
- what don &apos;t you understand ?
girls get all goofy over boys .
they talk about silly pop groups and clothes and say things like ,
&quot; why are you so grumpy ? &quot; when i &apos;m happy .
and i say , &quot; i &apos;m happy . &quot; and they say , &quot; well , you don &apos;t look happy . &quot;
and i say , &quot; can &apos;t you see i &apos;m thinking ?
and can &apos;t you see i &apos;m sad ? &quot;
and i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
what do you look like when you &apos;re happy ?
like this .
_removed_
_removed_
you looked like this .
that &apos;s funny looking .
happy . and that &apos;s you angry .
happy . i &apos;m happy in that one .
i &apos;d say more satisfied .
satisfied .
maria , can you give me a hand here ?
temple !
temple !
close it on me .
- temple , let &apos;s get you out of ... - close it on me !
- don &apos;t be silly !
- please !
close the sides . close the sides .
please !
harder !
more !
did you see temple &apos;s handiwork at the gate ?
isn &apos;t that the darndest thing ?
hi .
- hi , darling .
- hi .
all these years ann &apos;s been bugging me , like i could ever come up with that !
is that it ?
is that what temple &apos;s been using ?
yes , it is .
i know , it looks horrible , but it helps her .
i &apos;ll go find temple . temple !
that &apos;s mine . that &apos;s temple &apos;s .
she &apos;s had a great summer .
you won &apos;t believe the things she &apos;s fixed .
- she &apos;s wonderful with the cattle .
- yeah . i ... i appreciate that .
i should warn you , she has her mind set on staying .
that &apos;s not an option .
ann .
i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean to attack you , especially when you &apos;ve been so generous all summer .
temple ?
temple ?
temple .
how was your trip , mother ?
you made good time .
it was long . thank you for asking .
you ready for college ?
i think i &apos;d rather stay here .
we &apos;ve talked about this .
sweetheart , you &apos;re gonna be fine .
no one expected it . it &apos;s nothing short of a miracle .
it &apos;s a miracle !
temple , this way .
- can i get that for you ? - thank you .
224 . this is you .
- i don &apos;t have a roommate . - no , no , no .
your roommate is coming in another couple of weeks .
remember ?
everyone else has a roommate !
well , then , why don &apos;t you just think of it as a chance to settle in , sweetheart ?
- think i &apos;ll go back home ! - temple .
i know that this is strange and new ,
- but you &apos;re going to be all right .
- i don &apos;t want to stay here !
try and stay calm .
it &apos;s all right . try and calm down , all right ?
i &apos;m going to give you a moment to yourself .
- what &apos;s wrong ? - is she all right ?
interested in playing with other children ?
no , not really .
plays with toys , dolls ?
she loves to rip things .
and no speech yet at the age of ...
four . she &apos;s four .
no , not yet .
- i &apos;m sure it &apos;s just a phase , but ...
- your child is clearly autistic .
- autistic . i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m not familiar ...
- she &apos;s an infantile schizophrenic .
infantile ...
so ...
so when would she grow out of it ?
i mean , what &apos;s the next step for ...
we generally recommend an institution .
for how long ?
i &apos;m not sure i would like that . i really ...
i ... i wouldn &apos;t want to miss her first words .
she probably will never speak .
and i &apos;m afraid there is no course of treatment .
i &apos;m talking about institutionalization .
but ...
i mean , she ...
she was a perfectly normal baby and then later she changed .
so i need to know how , why .
i &apos;m not sure you &apos;d ...
perhaps if you had your husband call me .
my husband is a very busy man and i graduated from harvard ,
- so why don &apos;t you try me ?
- i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s been suggested that it may be a lack of bonding with the mother , that at a crucial phase , the mother was cold , aloof , when the child most needed physical affection .
but that is not what happened .
we have another child and she is not like this , and i did not do anything different .
temple rejects me .
i ...
i want to hug her and she won &apos;t let me .
i &apos;m supposed to have done this . well , then , i can undo it .
- you just tell me what to do . - as i said ,
i recommend institutionalization .
here &apos;s a list of facilities that we recommend .
dog .
dog .
temple . dog .
temple . cat .
cat . temple , try .
mommy .
mommy .
i know you can hear me .
all right . i think mommy needs a five-minute break .
okay ?

i don &apos;t want to study french . i want to learn science .
read the page , please .
read it .
and what did it say ?
son père est polytechni ... &quot; you ...
you learned it ?
i just looked at it .
then i have the page in my mind and can read off the page .
i see pictures and connect them .
hey , save me a seat !
let me see . come out here .
- john , i got one for you . - coming through .
watch out !
i only eat jell-o and yogurt !
i only ... i only eat jell-o and yogurt !
you see her ?
excuse me ?
i &apos;m your roommate .
what are you doing ?
it &apos;s a machine i just made .
it feels like a hug .
do you want a hug ?
it feels really good .
so when you got in your machine , did it make you feel like a cow ?
no , i didn &apos;t feel like a cow .
but it gave you pleasure .
it made me feel good , gentle .
- the hug made you feel good . - yes .
- but you don &apos;t like to be touched by people .
do you like to touch yourself ?
touching myself &apos;s okay .
but when the squeeze machine touches you ,
- it feels better ?
- yes .
it gives you release ?
yes , there is release .
- but i need it !
- let &apos;s take it down .
- i built it ! it &apos;s mine !
- what &apos;s all the noise ?
- wait !
stop it ! - pervert .
- got it ? okay .
- yeah , i got it .
twenty three hours , 59 minutes and four , three , two , one .
zero hour , mr. solo !
hey !
what are you doing ?
stop !
i said stop !
she says she &apos;s not going back after spring break unless she can take it with her .
- are you still there ?
- yes . and i really don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good idea .
it works for her .
it &apos;s everything we &apos;ve been struggling to get away from .
they were perfectly clear . no devices in her room .
could there be a better way to mark her as a weirdo and an oddball ?
just let us try , okay ?
so that &apos;s it .
okay !
it makes me gentle .
she &apos;s a different person after just 15 minutes .
a different person ?
how can you explain that ?
i can &apos;t explain why the machine works , but i know it &apos;s not sexual .
as temple says , it calms her .
look , all this does is to convince me that we &apos;re not equipped to deal with ms. grandin &apos;s needs .
it makes her a better student .
she &apos;s able to concentrate , to interact with others more easily ...
this isn &apos;t very scientific .
- there is no empirical evidence ...
- i can do an experiment .
i can ... i can see how it works on other people .
i can measure heart rates . i think it &apos;ll work on everyone .
let &apos;s talk frankly .
i &apos;m not sure you can get anything from being at franklin pierce .
listen to what she &apos;s saying .
she wants to do her own science experiment , something you can evaluate in her psychology course .
i have a pen and a clipboard .
time .
do you feel , a , claustrophobic ,
b , constricted ,
c , no different ,
d , comfortable ,

- d , comfortable .
- yes , i &apos;m quite comfortable . - okay .
c , no different .
a , claustrophobic !
i guess i feel relaxed .
very relaxed .

hello , i &apos;m temple , very nice to meet you .
bonjour , mademoiselle . hi , i &apos;m dr. carlock . i teach science .

- temple .
hello , i &apos;m temple , it &apos;s very nice to meet you .
are you a scientist ?
i used to work for nasa .
temple &apos;s very interested in science .
i &apos;d like to meet belka and strelka .
they &apos;re the first dogs to come back from space alive .
that &apos;s right .
- in sputnik 5 , august 20th , 1960 . - sputnik 5 , august 20th , 1960 .
we &apos;re changing schools mid-term because temple &apos;s been expelled .
i &apos;m sorry , why was she expelled , again ?
hitting another child with a book .
there &apos;s no excuse , but i will say this in her defense .
i have never seen her strike unless she &apos;s been provoked .
and other children have taunted and bullied her constantly .
they make fun of her because she doesn &apos;t understand their jokes .
she spins to comfort herself .
she talks fast , often too fast , and she talks repetitively , and then the children called her a tape recorder .
then she &apos;ll go into a panic attack , and then they make fun of that , too .
excuse me . when was she diagnosed autistic ?
she was four , but i sometimes wonder if that &apos;s correct .
why do you say that ?
you &apos;ve seen her , she &apos;s bright .
we have a lot of experience with children with special needs , and emotional problems , neuro-behavioral issues that we &apos;ve made a number ...
- i think that because of ...
- i &apos;m so sorry .
i really have wasted your time . i just can &apos;t do this to her .
mrs. grandin . mrs. grandin .
mrs. grandin !
mrs. grandin , please !
can i speak with you for a moment , please ?
mrs. grandin , you don &apos;t strike me as the sort of person who would abuse their child or ... or deny them love and care ...
i ...
now , you wait .
i have done everything that i can for temple and if it isn &apos;t good enough , then it just isn &apos;t good enough .
but you cannot even begin to imagine the ... the chaos , the upheavals , the tantrums and the pain .
her pain .
you seem to be acting as if you have done something wrong , when ... when it &apos;s obvious you &apos;ve done everything right .
i ... i think she &apos;s terrific .
i know it &apos;s difficult when , as parents , we want our children to be everything we hoped for them to be and , if they &apos;re not , we think it &apos;s our fault and ...
and that there &apos;s never ever anybody out there who understands what we &apos;re going through .
it makes you feel alone , right ?
mrs. grandin , i &apos;m not an admissions person .
i ...
i just teach science , but i feel that this school might be the right place for your daughter .
i ... i &apos;d love to have her here .
the doctors wanted me to institutionalize her and ...
i don &apos;t know .
just dumping her at a boarding school , it just feels like another way to give her up .
but it &apos;s ... it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s just the first step in getting her out into the world . and ...
and i know you saw the children making fun of her
- and you want to protect her . - yeah , of course i do .
yeah , what parent doesn &apos;t want to ?
but at some point , she &apos;s going to hit life head on .
and trust me , we know how different she is .
different , not less .
different , but not less .
you watch . you &apos;ll ...
you &apos;ll make friends and you &apos;re gonna ride horses .
- okay ?
- okay .
okay .
what are you doing in with chestnut ?
no one is to go near that horse !
can he be my horse ?
he likes being hugged .
i want to ride him .
you &apos;ll ride . just not chestnut .
why are there so many fish in france ?
french fish !
french fish !
excellent work , temple . really excellent work .
- french fish !
- french fish !
- french fish !
- french fish !
hey !
what happened here ?
- she hit him for no reason !
- temple .
come on , let &apos;s go .
- and he &apos;s done it before !
- stop . stop . temple , stop .
temple , tim will be punished for what he did , but you cannot hit people .
you understand that ?
_removed_
_removed_
- but that &apos;s not fair !
- two weeks .
no , no . there &apos;s ... there &apos;s nothing there .
and he &apos;s been like this for three hours ?
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s anything anybody could have done .
i &apos;ll send the boy around with the truck . can you do it ?
i &apos;ll take care of it , dad .
temple ?
where do they go ?
i don &apos;t know .
heaven , maybe . somewhere .
temple , when animals and people die , they stay with us in our minds .
we can still see them .
so i think it would be best not to remember chestnut like this .
okay ?
i see chestnut the day i arrived .
i see grooming chestnut .
i see a picture of a horse just like chestnut in a book .
we passed a chestnut horse on route 119 near a feed store .
there was one on a calendar at aunt ann &apos;s , there was one in life magazine
- opposite the page of mr. kennedy ...
- okay . okay .
can you bring everything you &apos;ve seen to your mind ?
sure .
even if it were an everyday object , like , say , shoes ?
i see all the shoes i &apos;ve worn , my mother &apos;s and other people i &apos;ve met .
and you have three pairs , one needs a new heel .
- and i see the newspaper ads and tv ads and ...
can &apos;t you ?
- this girl has an amazing mind .
- try teaching her math .
- her algebra &apos;s hopeless . - or french .
- &quot; why are there so many fish in france ? &quot;
- i want to show you something .
she thinks in pictures .
that &apos;s why she does so well when she can see the things that are being discussed .
like biology .
or ... or shop .
those are concrete things . but language or algebra ?
- it &apos;s just gibberish to her . - what &apos;s that ?
do you want to see your &quot; french fish &quot; ?
&quot; the eels ate . &quot;
&quot; eel ate . &quot;
ils sont , il danse , il pense .
french is full of &quot; eels . &quot; and this is what she sees .
she &apos;s an amazing visual thinker .
- let me work with her . - fine .
we have five minutes left . who wants to see a movie ?
- yeah ! - all right .
- j.d. , will you do the projector ?
now everybody watch very carefully because this one is all about optical illusions .
it comes as a distinct shock to most people when they realize how limited and how inaccurate the human senses really are .
in this house , faces at the window seem to come in assorted sizes , don &apos;t they ?
that looks like mr. povey , doesn &apos;t it ?
but there &apos;s nothing wrong with the faces .
it &apos;s those windows and what they &apos;re doing to your brain .
all right , here we go .
a small one and a tall one .
let &apos;s see if we can even things out a bit .
- how do they do that ?
- sit down !
_removed_
that is the question , isn &apos;t it ?
&quot; how did they do that ? &quot;
well , that &apos;s this week &apos;s assignment . i want one page , at least .
- a full page ?
- all right , two ?
- no , no , no , no . - all right , one page . okay .
- they mess with the perspective !
- that &apos;s right , temple .
and it was a room built with distorted perspective .
- but how ?
- well , do you think you could figure it out ?
maybe if you visualized it ?
and if you build one , i &apos;ll give you extra credit .
yeah , okay .
hey !
weirdo !
does she have to chalk the walls ?
look at her .
- i can &apos;t do it !
- i think you can , temple .
but i can &apos;t !
i know , i know .
i shouldn &apos;t shout .
- but measuring perspective didn &apos;t work ! - um-hum .
hey , leigh , these are the specifications you need .
success , temple ?
no !
give me a clue , please !
you have to think of all the features in the room , the walls , the floors , the ceilings , the doors .
got it !
you &apos;ve already gone through this , right ?
well , you can tell that that &apos;s how she painted it .
this is what she was working on the other day .
i want to go through this . it &apos;s a strange optical illusion .
well , as you can see , the horses are the exact same size .
and here is the room .
temple , congratulations .
i think this deserves a round of applause .
i think it deserves a celebration .
yeah !
five , four , three , two , one .
now , here &apos;s a question .
if i wind this up and then let go , why doesn &apos;t the propeller stay still and the body of the plane spin around ?
that &apos;s simple . the resistance of the wings .
- that &apos;s absolutely right . - and watch this .
with no wings and just one plane of resistance ,
- you have a helicopter !
- you &apos;re absolutely right .
temple . you have a very special mind , you know that ?
you see the world in ways that others can &apos;t , and that &apos;s quite an advantage .
and you know something ?
if you weren &apos;t such a goof and you developed this talent , you could easily go on to college .
what would i do at college ?
well , with your mind , anything you wanted to . just pick a subject .
cows . do they have colleges with cows ?
yes , they do . and horses and pigs and goats and sheep and ...
yeah , it &apos;s called animal husbandry .
- animal husbandry .
- yeah , and it deals with the care of animals .
really , anything you wanted .
you could study people , psychology .
i &apos;d get to understand people ?
well , that &apos;s the idea .
i &apos;ll stay here .
temple , think of it as a door .
a door that &apos;s going to open up onto a whole new world for you and all you need to do is decide to go through it .
- miss grandin ?
- first off ,
i talked to my old teacher dr. carlock .
and he said i should stress that it wasn &apos;t that i hadn &apos;t done the work , because i had , but i &apos;d collected way too much data and backed it up with far too many citations , that i needed extra time just to make it coherent .
but if you look at these results , you &apos;ll see that it &apos;s not just me , but in fact , a majority of people who become calmer when using my machine .
and that really makes a clear case for me keeping it .
and i should get a good grade .
- did your ...
- certainly more than a pass .
did your previous teacher , dr. carlock , suggest the good grade ?
no , that &apos;s me .
leave it with me .
this is very important work !
you used a control group ?
they were tested resting , seated , and most of them got bored .
this is excellent . and i think it will be a good grade .
so i keep my machine .
in that case , i &apos;ll stay .
i would imagine your new roommate will want a say in whether you keep the machine .
that &apos;s my squeeze machine .
- do i have to move it ? - no .
but don &apos;t ever move it and then i &apos;ll always know where it is .
okay .
it &apos;s almost time for the man from u.n.c.l.e .
they play it in the rec room .
do you want to watch the man from u.n.c.l.e. ?
you can &apos;t watch the man from u.n.c.l.e .
i do . i &apos;d love to watch it .
- will you show me where it is ?
_removed_
now illya kuryakin &apos;s trying to open the door , but it &apos;s locked .
and now the floor &apos;s sliding under the room .
there &apos;s a big drop to lots of spikes !
that &apos;s the other kids in the room hissing .
- do you like star trek , too ? - yes .
- who &apos;s your favorite ?
- mr. spock .
we have a lot in common .
maybe we can watch it on the radio .
- they broadcast it for the blind . - they do ?
let &apos;s watch it on the radio .
you &apos;re quieter now .
is that because you &apos;re in your squeeze machine ?
well , i was just getting out .
- is my voice that different ?
- it is to me .
remember , i ... i see you through your voice .
do you remember a lot of voices ?
of course . but i remember the sounds of places , too .
we &apos;re the same , only you have sounds and i have pictures .
i ... i &apos;m off to class .
i have french class . i hate it .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m in my squeeze machine .
your squeeze machine doesn &apos;t bother me .
- okay ?
- i know . okay .
bonne chance .
good luck .
thank you .
excuse me , is this seat taken ?
no .
i &apos;ve always wanted to understand the gentleness that other people feel by being hugged by their mothers .
and now i &apos;ve made a machine that lets me do that .
it feels like a wire gets reconnected .
like something gets repaired .
if it wasn &apos;t for my machine , i wouldn &apos;t be standing here today .
instead i &apos;d be hiding in my room or spinning in circles to calm myself , or hitting someone .
when i was younger , i closed myself off from people .
i didn &apos;t even speak until i was four .
there &apos;s a highfalutin name for this condition . autism .
but because of my machine ,
i &apos;m able to know the kindness and love that have been given to me to reach this point in my life .
today more than ever , i realize i have not walked alone .
and i thank not only my teachers , but my friends and family as well .
as in the words of the song from carousel .
when you walk through a storm hold your head up high
and don &apos;t be afraid of the dark
at the end of a storm is a golden sky
and a sweet silver song of a lark
walk on through the wind walk on through the rain
though your dreams be tossed and blown
walk on , walk on
with hope in your heart
and you &apos;ll never walk alone

this is my door .
it opens to another world .
arizona state students , gather around .
all right . come on , everybody . come on down this way .
here we go .
all right , come on in . here we go . here we go .
everybody , come on . let &apos;s go .
all right , come on in closer now . gather around so you can hear .
all right , class , listen up .
this is don michaels . he runs the feedlot .
thanks , professor .
all right , what we got here at any one time is about 50 , 52,000 head of cattle .
now , they gotta weigh 650 pounds to get in here .
during the three or four months they spend here , they &apos;ll put on another 400 pounds before they move into the big house for slaughtering .
well , while they &apos;re here fattening up , we got to keep them healthy .
so one of the first things we do when they come in off the range is put them through a dip , get rid of any bugs .
- excuse me there , buddy . you okay ?
- that &apos;s a girl .
miss grandin .
miss , are you with us , here ?
- i was listening to the cattle . - oh , yeah ?
why are some mooing more loudly than others ?
i never heard so much mooing !
honey , i &apos;ve been around cattle all my working life .
about all i can tell you is that , just like the female of the species , cattle love to yammer and gossip or sulk .
it &apos;s always just one thing or the other .
- but like i was saying ...
- well , there must be a reason .
they &apos;re saying something .
well , i reckon you could get dr. dolittle on out here .
he probably could tell you .
while missy here is listening to what the cattle are saying to each other , why don &apos;t you boys step over here with me and see a dip in action ?
now , the biggest problem you got with a dip vat is that cattle can swim all right unless they tip on over .
then them babies &apos;ll drown real fast on you unless you get a hold of them and haul them out .
get up there . go !
well , there you go ! see , this is what i was telling you .
jesus !
come on , boys . earn your money !
hold them up over there !
hold them up !
come on , boys . we &apos;re gonna lose that baby .
roy !
roy , get a rope on this heifer and drag it out !
okay . okay .
well , there you go . you &apos;ll see inside .
it &apos;ll take more than that to kill a cow .
- get up !
get up !
- do you lose many ?
well , we got to run 300 of them through here in an hour .
i guess in a week , we &apos;ll lose one or two maybe .
we &apos;re doing pretty good .
dolittle , how you holding up ?
too much for you ?
they like to walk in circles .
well , what do you know , boys ?
cattle like to walk in circles !
dang , give that girl a prize .
it calms them down .
they walk in circles away from the handlers .
maybe you ought to wait out here when we go inside .
go !
then when we have it in the cage , it just takes one knock to the head .
so , dolittle , what do you think ?
- where does it go ?
- meat processing .
no , where does it go ?
it was here , and now it &apos;s meat .
where did it go ?
professor , i think maybe your young lady here ought to consider another line of work .
mooing ?
you want to do research and write your master &apos;s on mooing ?
curves . cattle like curves . they don &apos;t moo at curves .
miss grandin , when we accepted you , we were impressed you had excelled at your previous school .
a master &apos;s thesis on mooing strikes me as a lowering of the bar and i , for one , will not be the first person to give you an easy ride because of your autism .
- come up with something ...
- cattle are prey animals .
my autism allows me to understand prey animals well .
i can visualize the flight zones of cattle .
a handler outside the flight zone can keep an animal circling in a calm and orderly manner .
but stepping into the flight zone panics the cattle , and ... and they change from soft moos to loud mooing .
like , prey animals don &apos;t make noises that will draw attention to them unless they &apos;re trying to warn other members of the herd .
so they &apos;re warning each other they &apos;re going to be slaughtered ?
no . no . no , sir .
the ... the loud mooing is the same whether they &apos;re gonna be dipped , driven around a hard corner or taken to slaughter .
i mean , they have no idea what &apos;s gonna happen to them ...
- i &apos;m glad we agree on that .
- ... but they &apos;re spooked .
and spooked cattle don &apos;t act straight .
they get bruised , scraped , drowned , and that all costs money .
and it takes a good half hour to calm a herd and that costs money , too .
it &apos;s not a good way to run a stockyard .
well , i believe what &apos;s good for cattle is also good for business .
well , get the yard to sign off on it .
- you mean don . - that &apos;s who &apos;s in charge .
sorry , ma &apos;am . no women on the lot .
my name is temple grandin .
i &apos;m a grad student at arizona state ...
that &apos;s the rules , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;m a grad student at arizona state and i was here last week .
complaints from cowboys &apos; wives .
they just don &apos;t want no women on the yard .
i &apos;m just doing my job .
ma &apos;am , you &apos;re holding up the line .
you &apos;re going to have to turn around and take it on off the lot .
if you please .
don &apos;t come back .
john richmond , press , ranchman magazine .
go on in .
it &apos;s a door .
it &apos;s another door .
thanks , ma &apos;am . take care .
- good morning . - go on in .
- morning . - go on in .
- hi , sanch . - hey . hey , there .
good to have you back , son .
seems like a long time since you worked out here .
yeah , it does .
- what is this , a purple heart ?
- yeah , it is .
we &apos;re real proud of you .
gee , sanch , you didn &apos;t get all these just digging latrines .
- no , sir . i was in khe sanh .
- good for you .
excuse me , sir . i need you to sign off on my master &apos;s thesis .
- how &apos;d you get in here ?
- they just waved me in .
- what are you gonna research ?
- agitation in cattle .
would that be mooing ?
you believe that crap ?
since cattle are prey animals , loud mooing is a sign of ...
no way .
come on , sanch , let &apos;s get some coffee .
say , did you bring back one of them little china gals with you ?
no , they wouldn &apos;t let me bring back one on the airplane none .
you girls got the coffee ready in here ?
- we got a man that &apos;s thirsty . - come on in !
do you have another entrance ?
- pardon ?
- do you have another entrance ?
no , ma &apos;am .
do you have any jell-o or yogurt ?
in the cooler . right behind you , darling .

this is a waste !
hey !
you gotta remember to drink out here .
well , i have data on things that make them balk , like shadows , reflections on water , a chain glinting in the sun .
- is that right ?
- they won &apos;t walk into shaded areas .
they need to see where they &apos;re going .
i &apos;ve lots of important information on all this and i need mr. michaels to sign off on it .
don ?
don don &apos;t sign nothing .
- i need mr. michaels to sign ...
- you &apos;re not hearing me right .
don don &apos;t sign nothing .
i sign everything around here .
his signature , but i do the signing .
i &apos;m not even sure if don can write .
say , if you &apos;re interested in cattle and how cattle act , you shouldn &apos;t just hang around feedlots .
you should be out on ranches , auctions , rodeos , that sort of thing .
got the big steer here . 1,000 pounds .

excuse me , sir ? sir ?
i &apos;m very pleased to meet you .
i &apos;m temple grandin , a bachelor of science , doing my master &apos;s here at arizona state , currently studying in scottsdale feed yards , and i was wondering if i could interest the arizona farmer-ranchman periodical on a thesis i &apos;m writing on control systems and cattle
and why some work better than others and how they can tell the difference .
how &apos;d you get on with old don michaels over at scottsdale ?
i told him i &apos;ve eaten bull testicles , sir .
well , i will read anything you send in , miss grandin .
in fact , here , take my card . you address it directly to me .
thank you , sir . thank you !
it &apos;s open .
sir , scottsdale feedlot signed off on my cattle agitation study .
smells like half the herd signed it first .
- no , sir . cattle can &apos;t do that .
- and i don &apos;t need the magazine .
i &apos;m a subscriber .
well , i just wanted to make sure you saw my article on mooing as a guide to cattle agitation .
full thesis is still at the typist , but you should have it by friday .
temple ?
- let &apos;s go sing near the fire . - no , ralf .
# silver bells , silver bells ... #
temple !
well , master of science .
- master of science in animal science . - fantastic .
i &apos;ll bet you &apos;re glad to be back east .
- i like the west .
- so do i , but it isn &apos;t home , is it ?
what will you do with your master &apos;s ?
your mother mentioned teaching maybe .
great new school over west medford way .
i have a lot more research to do and things to write . so ...
that &apos;s right , you &apos;ve been published .
you remember scott ?
- scott ?
- scott ?
scotty , over here .
- i &apos;ll be right back . - he &apos;s our oldest boy .
new york magazine &apos;s taken a piece of his .
you remember scott ?
he used to spit in my jell-o .
i &apos;m sure he didn &apos;t . temple , tell scott about your writing .
i published two articles in the arizona farmer-ranchman .
- the arizona ...
- the arizona farmer-ranchman .
one was on good moos and bad moos .
the other was on head restraints in cattle chutes and killing pens .
they &apos;re really badly designed .
just terrible systems . just ...
it &apos;s lovely to see you , temple .
- bye . - merry christmas .
merry christmas !
i need my squeeze machine !
i hate parties .
there are too many people and no one listens to me .
and they keep giving each other looks and i don &apos;t know what they mean .
they &apos;re just uncomfortable .
people don &apos;t want to hear all those details about cattle .
well , i do . i wanna be with cattle .
sweetheart , i don &apos;t want you to avoid people .
- they make me feel bad . - then ignore them .
you are the only master of science in the room .
and i am so proud of you .
temple , look at me . look at me .
do you know how people tell each other things with their eyes ?
this is me telling you that i love you and i respect you .
i will never learn how to do that .
i know .
hey !
damn it !
you are not allowed in here .
- i &apos;m doing research for an article ...
- no , ma &apos;am .
we put up with you sneaking in here when you was at arizona state , but you &apos;re done with that .
no college , no insurance coverage , no access .
there are many other articles i would like to write for you .
firstly , how cattle can be introduced into dip vats on their own accord .
- secondly ...
- hold on , miss grandin .
firstly , your articles have been greatly appreciated .
i got a lot of calls .
folks think you talk sense .
secondly , i told you i would read anything that you write .
and , thirdly , young lady , you need another set of clothes
- when you come into town on business .
- i need to be an accredited press person .
- can i get a press pass ?
- you asking for a staff job ?
i ain &apos;t got but four staff , and ... and two of them are bookkeeping and distribution .
no , i don &apos;t wanna work here .
i wanna be with cattle , so i need a pass .
well , we can do that . but like i said ...
mary-anne ?
get in here .
sir ?
how &apos;s that working for you , miss grandin ?
it doesn &apos;t itch . i like it a lot .
that &apos;s my rank . they &apos;ll be able to see that .
hey , what ... damn it !
use it , temple . you stink .
- thank you . - temple ?
miss temple grandin ?
i &apos;m ted gilbert , from john wayne &apos;s red river feedlot .
hello , i &apos;m very pleased to meet you .
hell , i &apos;ve been reading your stuff .
how &apos;d you like to put it into practice ?
see , i lost my designer and i need a new cattle dip .
can you do it ?
it &apos;s pretty simple , but i got to present plans in five days .
sure !
this is very clever . how did you come up with this ?
i just see things and put them together .
- so how long will it take you to ...
- and all this ?
that &apos;s to lead the cattle in .
they &apos;re happy to follow a curve &apos; cause they think they &apos;re going back
- to where they came from . - if you say so .
i do . so how long will it take you to do it ?
well , i have two or three more before this .
- but i need it by tomorrow !
- everybody needs it tomorrow .
i won &apos;t work any quicker with you watching .
- well , i wanna watch . - okay .
hey , temple ?
this here is red harris from cattle magazine .
very nice to meet you , mr. harris .
yeah , red , he can &apos;t make the grand opening tomorrow , so i thought we &apos;d give him a sneak preview .
so , temple , will you put some cattle through your dip while i &apos;m here ?
okay .
hey , open the gate !
so if the handlers walk slowly clockwise outside the chute , then the cow will walk counterclockwise through the chute .
see ?
they &apos;ll just follow that curve .
the cattle just keep calmly walking thinking they &apos;re going in circles and following their buddies .
and they &apos;re happy to follow a curve because they think they &apos;re going back to where they came from .
they &apos;re okay because it &apos;s grooved and they know they won &apos;t slip .
so when they take the next step , their center of gravity makes them drop calmly into the dip and they just walk through the water .
i don &apos;t usually tell people what i &apos;m gonna write , but , miss grandin , this is a masterpiece .
- hey !
- i don &apos;t like to do that .
i &apos;m sorry there , temple .
now , look , i want you to be dressed in your best outfit tomorrow morning , okay ?
okay .
just look at this thing .
it &apos;ll take us forever to get them through here .
j.d. , i want you to get the torch and , red , i want this out , this out .
i want those panels lined up and we &apos;re gonna run them straight in .
come on , boys . you two come with me .
- grab the other end of this .
look at this !
i mean , look at that !
who &apos;d build something like that ?
jess , get me some sheet steel .
we &apos;re gonna slide these puppies in here .
- eric , where &apos;s that sheet steel ?
- hurry up !
let &apos;s go . get up .
put them over in that pile and get them out of here .
she &apos;s here .
don &apos;t keep worried , boys . i &apos;ll take care of her . pick it up .
miss .
some dip you got here .
who put steel on that slope ?
cattle can &apos;t walk on steel !
that &apos;s designed so they &apos;ll walk slowly !
excuse me , little miss . we just had three head drown in here .
that &apos;s your fault !
you killed them &apos; cause of your stupidity !
and why ain &apos;t they coming through the curved chute ?
that &apos;d take us all day , little lady !
hey , that &apos;s my shirt !
if it &apos;s smooth , they &apos;ll follow it !
if there &apos;s stuff on it , they &apos;ll get scared !
you can &apos;t hang things !
- you wacko !
- put it all back the way it was !
temple , what &apos;s going on here ?
they killed three cattle because of their stupidity !
they ruined it !
just a minute !
- cattle aren &apos;t dangerous !
- temple ?
and they &apos;re predictable .
so it &apos;s not hard to design
- a system that won &apos;t hurt them ! - what are you doing in california ?
but the cowboys would rather prod them and scare them .
- did you drive all night ?
- i designed a dip vat at john wayne red river feedlot based on the way cattle see and think and behave and the editor of cattle magazine said it was a masterpiece , but the cowboys killed three cows in it !
three . in five minutes .
because they wouldn &apos;t follow my design !
- temple , would you like to sit down or ...
- i can &apos;t protect the cattle ...
_removed_
... unless i design the whole system from the moment they enter to the moment they get slaughtered .
are you talking about a slaughterhouse ?
well , of course they &apos;re gonna get slaughtered .
do you think we &apos;d have cattle if people didn &apos;t eat them every day ?
they &apos;d just be funny-looking animals in zoos .
no , we raise them for us .
that means we owe them some respect .
nature is cruel , but we don &apos;t have to be .
i wouldn &apos;t want to have my guts ripped out by a lion .
i &apos;d much rather die in a slaughterhouse if it was done right !
well , it seems to me that you should be
- we can easily do it in a way where they don &apos;t feel pain and they don &apos;t get scared .
and their cortisol levels go through the roof !
okay . did you hear what i said , temple ?
i think you &apos;re the one
- who should design the slaughterhouse .
- yeah , i &apos;m going ...
i know a slaughterhouse that &apos;s a mess and i know exactly how to fix it .
it &apos;s a door . it &apos;s another door .
can i help you ?
hello , it &apos;s very nice to meet you .
i &apos;d like to tour your slaughterhouse .
excuse me ?
hello , it &apos;s very nice to meet you .
i &apos;d like to tour your slaughterhouse .
we don &apos;t do tours , ma &apos;am .
i designed a dip vat at john wayne &apos;s red river feedlot that the editor of cattle magazine said was a masterpiece ...
security ?
can i get security to the front office ?
temple , i &apos;m so sorry to leave this message on your answering machine , but i thought you &apos;d want to know that your friend dr. carlock has died .
- well , i just saw him !
- apparently , he &apos;d been sick for some time .
you can call me anytime . bye , sweetheart .
i just saw him .
what are they doing ?
they &apos;re paying their respects .
it &apos;s a way of saying thank you and goodbye .
i said goodbye when i saw him .
and this is a final chance to say goodbye .
temple . temple . are you all right ?
i &apos;m leaving now .
well , it isn &apos;t over yet .
i said goodbye when i saw him . he &apos;s not there .
i &apos;ve got him in my mind .
do you know where they go ?
no . no , i don &apos;t .
okay . i &apos;m gonna go now .
drive safely .
there you are , ma &apos;am .
my , that &apos;s a pretty blouse .
i hope you don &apos;t mind me saying so .
some people think i &apos;m forward , but , you know , if i like something ,
i just come right out and just compliment them .
it &apos;s nice to get a compliment , don &apos;t you think ?
thank you . it &apos;s very nice to meet you . i &apos;m temple grandin .
well , i ... it &apos;s nice to meet you , too . i &apos;m betty .
well , then , there we are .
are you waiting to meet somebody or something ?
no , i have trouble with automatic doors sometimes when i &apos;m nervous .
i &apos;m autistic .
my son is artistic and he &apos;s got the same thing with airplanes .
come on . you just come along with me .
all right . come on . and ...
all right ?
you are safe now . you &apos;re safe .
- thank you . - my pleasure .
are you a horsewoman ?
i mean , you know , your shirt ?
well , i like horses , but i work with cattle .
i designed a dip that cattle magazine called brilliant .
oh , my golly , my husband read about you .
he works over at abbot .
- abbot slaughterhouse ?
- yeah . you heard of it ?
well , i wanna redesign it .
i went there , but they wouldn &apos;t let me meet with them .
but i have several ideas about how to make a new facility that will be much more humane and efficient .
well , i guess you just have to meet my husband then .
how wonderful that we bumped into each other .
- a door opened and i went through it .
- yes , you did .
and i held it .
this looks like an airport for cows .
- yeah . - yeah .
- thank you . - i didn &apos;t mean that as a compliment .
and conveyor belts for cattle ?
do you have any idea what the cost is on this ?
and you &apos;ve got solid walls and floors .
we have those slatted for a reason . it &apos;s cheaper .
i &apos;m sorry , miss grandin .
it &apos;s clear you just don &apos;t have the experience to design something like this .
the walls are solid so the cattle won &apos;t be distracted by light or movement outside .
- they balk at unexpected things .
- i &apos;m sure that &apos;s nice for the cattle ,
- but the cost , miss ...
- how much money does it cost you to pay handlers to prod the cattle along and then hold them back when they stampede ?
how many times a day do your chutes stop because of pile-ups ?
how many cows break a leg and bring everything to a halt ?
with my system , there &apos;d be none of that .
there &apos;d be a steady , calm flow .
well , that sounds great , but you don &apos;t have any idea of whether it &apos;ll work or not .
but i do . i &apos;m like nikola tesla or thomas edison .
i know my system will work &apos; cause i &apos;ve been through it a thousand times in my head .
i can see a chute just as the cattle will because that &apos;s something my autism lets me do .
i can walk through a plan in my mind , examining every beam and every rivet .
i mean , you just see a plan , but i &apos;m walking through the whole plant .
okay , the cattle go through a series of solid curves .
and the floor is solid , too , grooved .
the chute gets smaller , but the cattle won &apos;t mind .
they don &apos;t ...
they don &apos;t see any danger .
they think they &apos;re just getting into another truck .
the stairway leads them gently upwards .
the floor becomes a conveyor .
a rest rises up to meet their chest so they &apos;re comfortably carried .
they &apos;ll be very calm .
nature is cruel , but we don &apos;t have to be .
we owe them some respect .
i touched the first cow as it was being stunned .
in a few seconds , it was gonna be just another piece of beef , but in that moment , it was still an individual .
it was calm .
and then it was gone .
i became aware of how precious life was .
and i thought about death and i felt close to god .
i don &apos;t want my thoughts to die with me .
i want to have done something .
thank you for inviting me .
you &apos;re the one person i wanted here .
other people would have been overwhelmed by what they were seeing .
it would have confused them .
i knew that you would be the only one able to sense what was really going on , who could feel what i was trying to accomplish .
i know there are a lot of things i can &apos;t understand , but i still want my life to have meaning .
i don &apos;t know that i want to hear from any more experts .
- that doesn &apos;t work !
- we &apos;ve been trying those things for years !
will you please let me finish ?
with intensive psychotherapy , an autistic child can be treated ...
but the rimland report plainly shows that autism is not a psychological problem .
- i am not familiar with the rimland report .
- calm down . calm down .
calm down , sweetie . sweetie , calm down . calm down .
it would be better if you could get her to sit calmly .
- you know , try to control her . - what are you talking about ?
but we were told self-stimming is good . it eventually calms them .
self-stimming is self-comforting .
self-stimulation , rocking , spinning , rolling on the floor , flapping the ...
well , i think spinning is good .
and rolling , too .
self-stimulation does seem to eventually calm the nervous system .
it can be a way to compensate for not being held .
and being held by another person is scary , but rolling or , or being held by surfaces produces the calming effect that ordinary children get from a hug .
how old is your child ?
well , i don &apos;t have children .
no , i &apos;m autistic .
and i need the sensation of being hugged .
and i &apos;ve developed a machine that i get into and hugs me and i &apos;m different afterwards .
well , i didn &apos;t speak until i was four and now i have a b.a. and a master &apos;s and i &apos;m studying for my doctorate .
- how did you learn to speak ?
- how &apos;s it possible ?
please don &apos;t shout . please don &apos;t ...
most autistic people are very sensitive to sounds and colors .
over-stimulation hurts .
you know , people talking too much at once , you know , can cause us to panic .
how did you get cured ?
well , i &apos;m not cured . i &apos;ll always be autistic .
my mother refused to believe that i wouldn &apos;t speak .
and when i learned to speak , she made me go to school .
and in school and at home , manners and rules were really important .
they were pounded into me . i was lucky .
all these things worked for me .
everyone worked hard to make sure that i was engaged .
i mean , they knew i was different , but not less .
you know , i had a gift .
i could see the world in a new way .
i could see details that other people were blind to .
my mother pushed me to become self-sufficient .
i worked summers at my aunt &apos;s ranch .
i went to boarding school and college and those things ...
those things were uncomfortable for me at first , but they helped me to open doors to new worlds .
excuse me , please , but we want to hear everything .
- yes . please . - yes .
- please , everything you can tell us .
- yes . tell us , please .
are you a scientist ?
- french fish !
- french fish !
- you cannot hit people . - you think you can figure it out ?
- five , four , three , two , one .
- i have a pen and a clipboard .
think of it as a door .
- it just takes one knock to the head .
- i don &apos;t understand why people are cruel
- for no reason ! - you have a very special mind .
you see the world in ways that others can &apos;t .
miss grandin , this is a masterpiece .
- a door opened and i went through it .
- yes , you did .
and i held it .
i &apos;m temple grandin .
