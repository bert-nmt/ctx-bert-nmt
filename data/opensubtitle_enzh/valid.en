what a terrific crowd !
welcome to my in@@ au@@ gu@@ ration !
i &apos;m lucy . lucy mi@@ ran@@ do , of the mi@@ ran@@ do corpor@@ ation .
welcome to my grandfather &apos;s old factory .
now , i know , we all know , that grandpa mi@@ ran@@ do was a terrible man .
we know of the at@@ ro@@ cities he committed in this space .
we know these walls are stained with the blood of fine working men .
but today , i re@@ claim this space ... to tell you a beautiful story .
now the rotten ce@@ os are gone .
it &apos;s mi@@ ran@@ do &apos;s new era with me , and with new core valu@@ es , environment and life .
awesome .
you &apos;re much more fun than the last chief executive .
well , former ce@@ o nancy &apos;s my sister , but ...
we &apos;re very different people .
we have very different ways of being . we have very different business ethi@@ cs .
but she &apos;s totally igno@@ rant about humanity .
she l@@ acks vision beyond her next round of golf .
the world &apos;s population is at seven billion .
8@@ 0@@ 5 million human beings struggle with hun@@ ger every day , including 30 million right here in the united states .
the world is running out of food , and we &apos;re not talking about it .
we needed a miracle .
and then we got one .
say hello to a super pi@@ g@@ let .
this beautiful and special little creature was mirac@@ ul@@ ously discovered on one chi@@ lean farm .
we brought this precious girl to the mi@@ ran@@ do ranch in ari@@ z@@ ona .
our scientists have been raising her with love and care ever since , ob@@ serving and performing various studies .
and we &apos;ve success@@ fully re@@ produ@@ ced 26 miracle pi@@ g@@ lets by non@@ forced , natural ma@@ ting .
they are like nothing on earth .
last week , we sent the 26 super pi@@ g@@ lets to the 26 countries where the mi@@ ran@@ do offi@@ ces are located .
each one was given to an e@@ ste@@ e@@ med local farmer .
i have asked each farmer to raise their special guest , hon@@ or@@ ing traditional techni@@ ques unique to their respe@@ ctive cul@@ tures .
my top scientists in the mi@@ ran@@ do branch offi@@ ces will be on hand to offer whatever support is required .
these little pi@@ g@@ gies will be the ancestors of a whole new species .
mama nature &apos;s gift .
a revolution in the li@@ ve@@ stock industry .
and now we have a competition !
one local farmer will raise the biggest , most beautiful and special one .
the ultimate super pig !
but who will it be ?
i &apos;m not an expert , but i know someone who is .
tv &apos;s most beloved zo@@ o@@ logist and veter@@ in@@ ari@@ an , and the new face of the mi@@ ran@@ do corpor@@ ation ,
dr. johnny wil@@ co@@ x !
who said a brilliant scientist can &apos;t be fun ?
see , everybody wants to eat him up .
when the competition re@@ aches its cli@@ max ,
dr. johnny will crown the winner at a magical animals live tele@@ cast right here in new york city .
and that is when we will un@@ ve@@ il our super pigs to the world !
how long will the wait be ?
when do we get to see the big pig with our own eyes ?
ten years .
ten years ?
jesus christ , i &apos;ll be dead by then .
our super pigs will not only be big and beautiful , they will also leave a min@@ ima@@ l foot@@ print on the environment , consu@@ me less feed and produce less ex@@ cre@@ tions .
and most import@@ antly ... they need to taste fucking good .
it won &apos;t hurt . don &apos;t move .
it &apos;s okay .
not too hard !
they &apos;re not even ri@@ pe yet .
you had some already !
ok@@ ja !
ok@@ ja , what are you doing ?
look at all the fish here !
i want fish ste@@ w today !

mi@@ ja jo@@ o of 3@@ 7@@ -@@ 1 , s@@ any@@ ang town !
pro@@ mp@@ tly return home for dinner . mi@@ ja !
come home quick . grandpa is starving !
don &apos;t be scared . it &apos;s a short@@ cut .

where are you ?
mun@@ do from the office is coming to visit .
mun@@ do ?
to collect the money for ok@@ ja ?
i &apos;ve already sent them the money .
so ok@@ ja is ours now , right ?
of course .
so why is he coming ?

he &apos;s the &quot; very healthy &quot; guy !
all the other super pigs were on flat land , acce@@ ssi@@ ble by car .
japan &apos;s one was five minutes from the airport .
and you ...
i notice that you had to leave the fucking moun@@ tain@@ top super pig till the end , because you knew that the climb would ri@@ le me .
well , guess what ?
i &apos;m ri@@ led .
he looks exactly like he does on tv .
oh , that &apos;s great .

can somebody at least bring me some water ?
seeing as i &apos;m about to be fil@@ med for fucking television !
and not spar@@ k@@ ling water . i don &apos;t want to bel@@ ch my way through the broadcast .

ten years ago , 26 local farmers from 26 far@@ -@@ f@@ lung countries were each given a super pi@@ g@@ let .
- what &apos;s he saying ?
- dun@@ no .
one of those 26 far@@ ms to decide who will be invited to the best super pig fe@@ st in new york city , where it will be un@@ ve@@ iled to the world .
you &apos;ve done an incredible job .
thank you .
pan to the old man !
- pan to johnny .
- johnny , johnny !
ever since she was little , i &apos;ve always been fascin@@ ated with ok@@ ja and her mon@@ thly health reports and data .
i &apos;ve only known her through numbers and grap@@ hs and pictures , but seeing her here today , and studying her with my own eyes and hands , she ama@@ zes me even more .
this is it .
the moment of mutual trust between mi@@ ran@@ do &apos;s very own dr. johnny and the e@@ ste@@ e@@ med local farmer .
she &apos;s truly excep@@ tional .
how did you do it ?
what were your methods ?
he just let her run around .
&quot; he just let her run around . &quot; how be@@ gui@@ ling !
show the sa@@ sh to the camera , jennifer , and go ...
- ready for the festival in new york city ?
- new york ?
very healthy .
one more sa@@ sh , please .
a special sa@@ sh for a special little lady , who i &apos;m sure helped raise this super pig in her own special little way .
and cut . get some cu@@ ta@@ ways of the pig !
here . auto@@ graph , please .
i guess i &apos;m still hip in korea .
the kids at home don &apos;t really appreciate me anymore .
but here ...
i &apos;m sorry if i was a little gru@@ mpy when i first came to the farm .
but , you know , being a television presen@@ ter can be stre@@ ss@@ ful .
i always have to be &quot; on , &quot;
now that i &apos;m the face of the mi@@ ran@@ do corpor@@ ation .
who ever thought that would happen ?
mi@@ ja . let &apos;s go visit your mom and dad .
now ?
i want to watch this .
they &apos;ll be doing this all day .
your mom and dad appeared in my dream last night and said they missed you .
come on .
thank you .
come quick .
it won &apos;t take long .
who do you miss more ?
mom or dad ?
i can &apos;t remember ... their faces .
it &apos;s been so many years .
just the two of us in the mountains .
not two . three .
oh , sure . three .
the three of us .
ok@@ ja , too .
our little fa@@ tty !
what &apos;s that ?
this is ... a gold pig .
100 % real gold .
in the old days , the el@@ ders would give a gold pig to their daughters as a wedding gift .
mi@@ ja , it &apos;s yours now .
take it .
why all of a sudden ?
well , you &apos;re not getting married now ... but ...
ok@@ ja is going far away ... so you can keep this gold pig instead .
what ?
the pig competition &apos;s nearly over .
so they &apos;re taking all the pigs back to the company .
but ok@@ ja &apos;s ours .
we bought her from them .
you sent them the money !
actually ... they wouldn &apos;t let me buy ok@@ ja .
so i bought you this gold pig instead .
what are you talking about ?
hey , did you hear that ?
your daughter ra@@ ises her voice at me now .
mi@@ ja .
they say ok@@ ja was sele@@ cted as the best pig .
they have plans for her in america .
america ?
she &apos;ll spend the night at the mi@@ ran@@ do building in seoul .
and tomorrow , she &apos;ll be on a plane to america .
she &apos;s a celebri@@ ty now !
mi@@ ja .
to be honest ... you &apos;re nearly a grown woman now .
i don &apos;t like you playing with that pig all day .
you should go to town , meet a boy and ...
you must be hungry .
i made your favorite , chicken ste@@ w .
go wash up so we can eat .
i put in this and that .
everything that &apos;s good for you .
where are you going ?
seoul .
what ?
i &apos;m going to bring ok@@ ja home .
are you crazy ?
seoul ?
in the middle of the night ?

that &apos;s my voice . that &apos;s my actual voice .
my name is jay .
he &apos;s jay .
my name is k .
i &apos;m red .
- silver .
- i &apos;m blond .
i &apos;m mi@@ ja . this is ok@@ ja .
we are animal lovers .
we rescue animals from slaugh@@ ter@@ houses , zo@@ os , la@@ bs .
we tear down ca@@ ges and set them free .
this is why we rescu@@ ed ok@@ ja .
thank you very much .
for 40 years , our group has liber@@ ated animals from places of abuse .
- is that it ?
- yeah .
go on .
- it &apos;s very important she gets every word . - it &apos;s all right .
that &apos;s it .
we in@@ fli@@ ct economic damage on those who profit from their misery .
we reveal their at@@ ro@@ cities to the public .
and we never harm anyone , human or non@@ human .
that is our 4@@ 0-@@ year cre@@ do .
we ... fight people who harm animals ...
- what was the second thing you said ?
- we reveal their at@@ ro@@ cities ...
- are you okay , silver ?
- i &apos;m fine .
- you okay ? - i &apos;m good .
i &apos;m good .
he still hasn &apos;t eaten anything ?
no , he &apos;s ... still trying to leave the sma@@ l@@ lest foot@@ print on the planet that he can .
all food production is explo@@ ita@@ tive .
try this .
come on . it &apos;s just a toma@@ to .
ri@@ pen@@ ed in e@@ th@@ y@@ lene gas . transpor@@ ted in trucks .
i admire your convi@@ ction , silver , but your pal@@ lid comple@@ xi@@ on concerns me .
how long have you and ok@@ ja lived together ?
since she was four .
do you know where she was being taken ?
to america . to the best super pig competition .
yes . but she was being taken somewhere else first .
this is where they &apos;re really taking ok@@ ja .
this underground labor@@ atory in par@@ am@@ us , new jersey .
this is the building where ok@@ ja was created .
she thinks she was born in ari@@ z@@ ona and her mom in chi@@ le .
mi@@ ja . everything you believe you know about ok@@ ja is a lie .
ok@@ ja was created in this lab . so was her so-called mother .
this is the building where mi@@ ran@@ do experi@@ ments on their gene@@ tically mu@@ tated animals .
because gene@@ tic mu@@ tation is too dangerous ,
mi@@ ran@@ do &apos;s been disgu@@ ising it as natural , safe and non-@@ g@@ mo .
but that &apos;s a complete sca@@ m .
millions of g@@ m pigs are already lin@@ ing up in front of slaugh@@ ter@@ houses .
you and the other local farmers are just promo@@ tional dev@@ ices for them .
just a pic@@ tu@@ re@@ squ@@ e back@@ drop .
promotion .
mi@@ ran@@ do know their consu@@ mers would be disgu@@ sted by the idea of eating mu@@ tant , g@@ m foo@@ ds .
so ten years ago , their boss , lucy mi@@ ran@@ do , went inside the lab and dug around amongst all the dis@@ figured creatures to find the 26 pretti@@ est ones , like your ok@@ ja .
and then , big fan@@ fare , she sent them around the world .
they &apos;ve been fran@@ tically bre@@ eding their super pigs , and soon the super@@ mar@@ kets will be filled with their flesh and org@@ ans .
dog food , hot dogs , bacon and jer@@ ky ...
our plan is to put a stop to their project .
but to do so , we need video from inside the lab , footage of the horrible at@@ ro@@ cities being committed against the animals .
and there &apos;s a problem . the security is imp@@ ene@@ tr@@ able .
but there is a way .
although we will only go ahead with it if you give us your con@@ sent .
jay . if this kid doesn &apos;t give her con@@ sent , what , we just abandon the mission ?
is that what you &apos;re saying ?
&apos;cause , brother , we &apos;ve come halfway around the world for this .
- we should get this done now .
- don &apos;t be so selfish .
this isn &apos;t about you or us , and she is ok@@ ja &apos;s family .
so of course we need her con@@ sent .
i will not harm her by for@@ cing a mission upon her that she does not con@@ sent to .
as members of the a.@@ l.@@ f. , we are obli@@ ged to honor its cre@@ do .
we are going to ab@@ ort because some guy from the 197@@ 0s wrote a fucking cre@@ do ?
is that what you &apos;re saying ?
tradition does not make a movement strong .
we make a movement strong .
if that &apos;s how you feel , call yourself something else and not the a.@@ l.@@ f. , and get out of this truck .
in order to ex@@ pose mi@@ ran@@ do , we need video from inside the lab .
and this is where ok@@ ja comes in .
the mi@@ ran@@ do scientists are dying to run tests on her in their underground lab .
their star super pig . which is why we &apos;ve made this .
it looks exactly like the black box on her ear , right ?
only this one can wi@@ re@@ lessly send a video feed to us from inside the lab .
ok@@ ja will become a hidden camera .
hey , buddy .
hi .
okay .
i &apos;m sorry , but this was our plan .
rescue ok@@ ja , replace the black box and let mi@@ ran@@ do re@@ take ok@@ ja .
you want to send ok@@ ja to america ?
to this labor@@ atory ?
yes . but don &apos;t worry .
they wouldn &apos;t dare hurt her .
she needs to be perfect for their beauty pa@@ ge@@ ant .
whatever tests they do on her in there will need to be har@@ mless .
we have a deta@@ iled plan on how to rescue her from the event in new york city .
we promise to bring her back to you .
if our mission succe@@ eds , we &apos;ll be able to shut down mi@@ ran@@ do &apos;s super pig project completely .
and we &apos;ll be saving millions of super pigs like ok@@ ja from death .
but we won &apos;t do it without your approval .
if you don &apos;t approve , we won &apos;t do the mission .
what is your decision ?
take ok@@ ja back to the mountains .
she agre@@ es to the mission .
thank you .
- thank you so much .
- this is a giant lea@@ p for animal kind .
thank you .
it &apos;s zi@@ plo@@ c .
- water won &apos;t be so bad .
- it &apos;ll be great !
move ! move !
i &apos;m gonna do it ! holy shit , i &apos;m gonna do it !
go , go , go , go , go , go .
hey !
ok@@ ja , i &apos;ll see you in new york .
till we meet again .
mi@@ ja !
try learning english . it opens new doors !
hey , wait !
mister !
hey , you !
grab him !
he jumped !
how did he do that ?
hey , kid . it &apos;s dangerous .
get out of there .
hey , kid . hey , come out !
- are you kidding me ?
- it &apos;s supposed to hold .
you &apos;re a fucking jok@@ e-@@ show , mate .
- fucking awesome , epi@@ c plan , man .
- it &apos;s a zi@@ plo@@ c .
- fucking zi@@ plo@@ c , my ass .
- it was supposed to hold .
seriously ?
- you okay ?
- yeah .
last night in south korea ,
mi@@ ran@@ do employees were secu@@ ring their super pig when a young girl suddenly stepped in and tried to stop them .
these extraordinary events began earlier in the day with a high@@ ly-@@ organized pi@@ gn@@ apping attempt made by the animal liber@@ ation front .
i wouldn &apos;t worry too much , lu@@ ce . the a.@@ l.@@ f. technically failed .
they weren &apos;t even able to take the product .
yeah , it &apos;s a ker@@ fu@@ ffle over nothing . we shouldn &apos;t make a big deal out of it .
it actually means our security here in the us is so air@@ tight , they wouldn &apos;t even think about breaking in .
which is why they went all the way to korea .
the a.@@ l.@@ f. hasn &apos;t been in the head@@ lines for a number of years , but they &apos;re back in the sp@@ ot@@ light after today &apos;s cha@@ otic events .
well , the good news is that the pig is on its way to new york now .
right . and the best super pig fe@@ st will continue as planned .
significant damage to mi@@ ran@@ do &apos;s stock price seems in@@ evi@@ table .
yeah . mi@@ ran@@ do is completely fucked .
mi@@ ran@@ do . that &apos;s your current emplo@@ yer , correct ?
yup . but i don &apos;t care .
they fucked , not me .
they fucked up .
i know what they &apos;re calling me , those a.@@ l.@@ f. fuckers .
they &apos;re calling me a psycho@@ path .
you &apos;re not a psycho@@ path .
they &apos;re the psycho@@ paths . right , ms. mi@@ ran@@ do ?
they &apos;re nar@@ ci@@ ssi@@ sts .
do nar@@ ci@@ ssi@@ sts wear bal@@ ac@@ la@@ v@@ as ?
crazy radi@@ cals have been calling us psycho@@ paths since the &apos; 6@@ 0s .
&quot; you &apos;re a psycho@@ path .
your sister was a psycho@@ path . your father was a psycho@@ path . &quot;
well , daddy was a psycho@@ path , frank . i mean , that &apos;s hardly an unfair slu@@ r .
&quot; what did you do in the war , daddy ? &quot;
&quot; i manufac@@ tured the nap@@ al@@ m that made everybody &apos;s skin fall off . &quot;
and this is a man who called his child an idiot loser .
well , in fair@@ ness to your father , when he called you an idiot loser , you had just signed up for a two-@@ year course in california called &quot; un@@ lea@@ sh your calling . &quot;
at a high@@ ly-@@ respected institu@@ te for the advan@@ cement of human potential where many a for@@ war@@ d-@@ looking ce@@ o go .
and you know what i was doing while i was at the institu@@ te ?
i was vi@@ su@@ ali@@ zing new and better ways of doing business .
while my sister was ce@@ o ...
what was the name of that lake ?
mo@@ ose lake .
mo@@ ose lake .
while my sister was ce@@ o , du@@ mping so much toxi@@ c waste into mo@@ ose lake that it explo@@ ded ...
the only lake ever to explode . well done , nancy .
i was vi@@ su@@ ali@@ zing ways of turning the most hated ag@@ ro@@ chemical company in the world into the most li@@ k@@ eable miracle pi@@ g-@@ re@@ aring company .
and it &apos;s working ! it &apos;s working !
it was working until last night .
until six hours ago .
the syn@@ the@@ sis of old mi@@ ran@@ do and new mi@@ ran@@ do was imp@@ ec@@ cable .
i took nature and science , and i syn@@ the@@ si@@ zed .
and everyone loved it .
you remember what the new york times said about our super pigs ?
&quot; in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing , &quot; right ?
s@@ late ! &quot; lucy mi@@ ran@@ do is pulling off the impossible .
she is making us fall in love with a creature that we are already looking forward to eating . &quot;
i mean , these are journa@@ lists who never write about pigs .
they never write about pigs !
they wrote about our pigs .
ten years in planning !
on the cu@@ sp of a product launch that will feed millions !
and what happens ?
we get tan@@ gled up in this terrori@@ sm thing , and somehow we end up being the ones who look bad .
we don &apos;t look too bad .
- we don &apos;t ?
open that thing !
- yup .
no , re@@ wind . re@@ wind .
re@@ wind !
okay , play .
the girl was later revealed to be the grand@@ daughter of a local farmer sele@@ cted by mi@@ ran@@ do ce@@ o ...
pa@@ use , there .
that &apos;s it .
that is the image that is gonna destroy us .
who are those mor@@ ons ?
find out and fire them .
sure .
abu@@ sing that adorable girl .
and in the uni@@ forms that i personally designed myself .
and sho@@ ving her best friend onto a truck .
that &apos;s gonna kill us .
right there . that &apos;s it .
that image . we &apos;re dead .
lucy , may i ask you a question ?
the girl . you &apos;re thinking of bringing her to new york , aren &apos;t you ?
i was about to say that !
yes , of course .
you &apos;ll invite her to the best super pig festival and ...
a moving re@@ union !
the best super pig and the adorable farmer girl forced apart and somehow brought together on our stage .
brilliant , lucy .
an emotional re@@ union , and then they leave the stage together .
hand in hand . hand in tro@@ tter .

turn it off !
i know it &apos;s painful .
but we can &apos;t be weak .
that &apos;s right .
this is why we need to stay focused .
this is why we need to stick to the mission .
the little girl trusted us with ok@@ ja . we have to respect her bra@@ very .
she never agreed to send ok@@ ja .
what &apos;d you just say ?
she was in our truck .
she said ...
i wanna take ok@@ ja back to the mountains .
i lied .
- god .
- why did you lie ?
i don &apos;t know . in that moment , it &apos;s just ... i couldn &apos;t ...
i couldn &apos;t stop the mission .
you know , this is ...
this is the coo@@ lest mission ever .

- hey , k ... k .
it &apos;s okay .
i hold you dear to my heart , but you have dish@@ on@@ o@@ red the 4@@ 0-@@ year history and meaning@@ ful leg@@ acy of the animal liber@@ ation front .
you have betrayed the great minds and brave fighters that have preced@@ ed you .

trans@@ lation is sacred .
from this moment on , you are no longer a member of the a.@@ l.@@ f. you are perman@@ ently ban@@ ned .

this is an un@@ spea@@ k@@ able place .
i know . i know .
there are worse rooms out there .
lucy mi@@ ran@@ do says i &apos;m not supposed to harm you in here .
well , at least not visi@@ bly .
she wants you perfect for her big tele@@ cast !
but ... when a woman humili@@ ates a man in front of his own colleagues , a man is in@@ cl@@ ined to make his own decisions .
this is nothing , really .
it &apos;s used on beef . i mean , live cows .
to check their mar@@ bling .

four or five . no more than six blocks .
and what about the cat ?
-@@ shit , the cat .
-we didn &apos;t discuss the cat .
your father will pick him up on those days when you switch houses .
i &apos;ll drive here two more times a week ?

if it was near here , it wouldn &apos;t be a problem .
this neighborhood got expensive .
it &apos;s painful for me to stay in this neighborhood . don &apos;t be difficult . i feel bani@@ shed .
oh , pick@@ le .
-@@ dad , what will happen with the cat ?
-we &apos;ll figure something out .
is it because dad isn &apos;t as successful as he used to be ?
now that you &apos;re publi@@ shing and he isn &apos;t , is that it ?
-that &apos;s not nice to say .
-this is a great family .
why are you screwing it up ?
-@@ lf we could avoid it , i would .
-you &apos;ve been together 1 6 years .

we &apos;ll put them back on the shel@@ f when your father leaves .

when my first novel came out , i had a lot of opport@@ uni@@ ties .
i was with your mother , so i didn &apos;t par@@ take .
i &apos;ve never had an affair with a student , though many have come on to me .
that &apos;s why you might not wanna be attached at your age .
it sounds like sophie &apos;s good for now .
-why &apos;d you yell , &quot; goddamn it &quot; ?
-i burned myself .
the cu@@ t@@ lets are great . dad , did you hear from that agent ?
-not yet .

what happened to your old agent , fred ?
he pissed me off .
made a disp@@ ara@@ ging re@@ mark about the kni@@ cks at a party .
said they played like thu@@ gs . i found it offen@@ sive .
he &apos;s kind of a jerk .
it was important to your mother that i achieve some sort of commercial success .

if you &apos;re interested , walt and i are taking a road trip to sun@@ y b@@ ing@@ ham@@ ton in a couple of week@@ ends .
_removed_
and an ex-@@ student of mine , now friend je@@ b ge@@ l@@ ber , is fe@@ ting me with a dinner .
excellent .
you should read the ca@@ the@@ dra@@ l scene from under@@ water .
i &apos;ve done that one a lot . i thought i &apos;d do something new .
but okay , well , maybe .
sorry , my nose is running .
i &apos;m your teacher .
i &apos;ve wondered for a long time what it &apos;d be like to fuck you .
i think we should wait .
really ?
yeah . yeah , let &apos;s wait .
okay , up next , walt ber@@ k@@ man who is going to play us a song .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to play lead guitar and do vo@@ cals on a song i wrote .
-that song was so good !
-thank you .
oh , dad , you remember sophie .
-and li@@ li .
-hi .
-how much did you win ?
-@@ hundred bucks .
come by my room tonight before you go to bed .
-i wanna show you something .
-okay .
and this is my mom and frank and ivan .
hi .
-@@ some song , brother .
-thanks .
hey , bernard .
i thought we &apos;d have dinner .
ivan suggested gage to@@ ll@@ ner . we &apos;d celebrate my book and your song .
-i &apos;m gonna go with dad .
-well , your dad and i ...
- ... talked about all of us going .
-i don &apos;t wanna do that . see you .
ivan and i came to see your show . don &apos;t treat us that way .
you think you hate me , but i know you don &apos;t .
where &apos;d you come up with those ly@@ ri@@ cs ?
they were very drea@@ m@@ like .
reminds me of my second novel , end of the line .
-a ro@@ ck-@@ star character in that .
-i love that novel .
classic . scenes with the baby in the middle are based on me as a baby .
right . it &apos;s ma@@ iler &apos;s favorite of my books .
and i loved your wife &apos;s piece in the new yo@@ r@@ ker .
really ? in the new yo@@ r@@ ker ?
-did you know about this ?
-i guess i did .
-how &apos;d that happen ?
-it &apos;s an ex@@ cer@@ pt .
-she &apos;s getting a novel published .
-really ?
walt showed it to me . it was kind of sad , but really good .
the por@@ tions are very big here . you only need half an order .
okay .
jesus , $ 1 5 for parking .
what do you think i should do about sophie ?
you &apos;ll make the right decision .
i regret sometimes i wasn &apos;t more of a free agent when i was younger .
a woman appro@@ ached me at a party at george pli@@ mp@@ ton &apos;s after my first book .
she was very sexy . i could &apos;ve gone home with her .
why didn &apos;t you ?
-i was with your mother .
-oh , right , of course .
you should &apos;ve probably done it . it didn &apos;t stop her .
maybe you should sleep with her once . see if you like it .
it doesn &apos;t mean you can &apos;t see other women too .
i don &apos;t know if sophie will go for that .
well , after your performance tonight , things might change for you .
-@@ wanna go to my house ?
we cou@@ ld@@ --
-@@ jesus !
-you really wanna do it , don &apos;t you ?
-i don &apos;t know .
-what &apos;s the obse@@ ssion with sex ?
-it &apos;s not an obse@@ ssion .
i &apos;m not so sure i wanna do it either . i &apos;m scared too .
scared is not the issue . everything is so serious suddenly .
-we &apos;re not getting married .
-what are you saying ?
nothing . i don &apos;t wanna feel this pressure .
do you like someone else ?
your dad &apos;s girlfriend ?
no . no . why ... ?
no . and she &apos;s not his girlfriend .
my dad said you had a weak hand@@ shake , a sign of in@@ decision .
his hands are huge , i can &apos;t get a good gri@@ p .
my mom said you don &apos;t have a good model for relationships ... - ... because of your parents .
-what ?
your mother doesn &apos;t know anything .
i thought it went well . you told me she said i was hila@@ rious .
don &apos;t be difficult . please .
you want a beer ?
i couldn &apos;t take re@@ lying on your dad &apos;s shopping ha@@ bits anymore .
you can have anything you want whenever .
thanks .
i &apos;m gonna read you a dra@@ ft of my new story .
i wanna hear your thoughts first . then i &apos;m gonna show it to your dad .
you like pink flo@@ yd , huh ?
-what ?
-don &apos;t worry .
i used to hand in lou re@@ ed ly@@ ri@@ cs in my poetry class and pass them off as my own .
although i hope you don &apos;t get caught . i always did .
do you-- ?
-@@ fuck !
-@@ sorry .
-@@ shit !
-@@ li@@ li , sorry .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s just a ....
-it &apos;s just a bloody nose .
-i &apos;m sorry .
-i might take a bath , okay ?
-oh , okay .
_removed_
-hey .
-hey .
-@@ when &apos;s bernard coming to get you ?
-@@ ln an hour .
plan on 30 minutes . he &apos;s always early to get you .
and late to bring you back .
-i wish i could come with you guys .
-i heard that .
i know . but dad &apos;s got you on satur@@ days .
-do you like his girlfriend ?
-@@ ls she his girlfriend ?
i thought so . she lives with you .
-he doesn &apos;t say ?
-no .
i think walt loves her .
-so they like the same women now too .
-what ?
it &apos;s nothing . you got our number in ma@@ ine . remember to lock up .
i will .
-@@ see you next week , pick@@ le-@@ oo .
-just pick@@ le , please .
i &apos;ll see you next week , just pick@@ le .
-good gri@@ p , brother .
-you too , brother .
dad , it &apos;s me .
are you there ?
pick up .
-how are you ?
-good to see you .
i &apos;m sorry about the tur@@ n@@ out . kids go home early for pas@@ so@@ ver .
they seemed to like it .
i mean , ma@@ stur@@ ba@@ ting is his own issue .
but he@@ ctor witne@@ ssed the locker incident and then later , se@@ men was found in the library .
who &apos;s he@@ ctor ?
how do you know they were both frank &apos;s ?
well , i suppose it &apos;s possible other kids are ma@@ stur@@ ba@@ ting and sp@@ reading their se@@ men around the school as well .
it &apos;s possible , but some@@ what un@@ likely .
oh , it happens , i &apos;m sure , more than we know .
bernard , have you ever done anything like this ?
i &apos;m not going to answer that .
has anything been going on at home that might &apos;ve pro@@ v@@ oked this behavior ?
well , bernard left him behind for three days last week .
of course , frank &apos;s mother divorced me earlier this year .
which also might have something to do with it .
ms. ber@@ k@@ man , i read your story in the new yo@@ r@@ ker .
-i thought it was quite moving .
-thanks .
thanks a lot .
you &apos;re living with a 20@@ -year-old .
-it &apos;s none of your business .
-lt is when you have our kids .
it &apos;s confu@@ sing for them .
frank says wait &apos;s in love with her .
walt has a girlfriend .
fuck off , joan .
i don &apos;t ask about you and ivan . stay out of my life .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;d talk to me like this .
you left all those fucking ticket stu@@ bs and letters lying around .
you wanted me to know .
it was fucking torture , joan .
fucking torture .
he made his own interpre@@ tation .
he &apos;s still gonna have to give the prize money back .
but obviously it &apos;s a bigger problem . he isn &apos;t doing his school@@ work either .
his paper on gatsby was quite brilliant , i thought .
it &apos;s one of his favorite books .
that may be , but i don &apos;t believe he &apos;s read it .
you both should talk to him .
i think bernard has to do it .
he wants you to see a therapist .
-i don &apos;t need that .
-that &apos;s what i said .
does si@@ mic know both your parents have ph@@ .@@ d. &apos; s in liter@@ ature ?
-i mentioned it .
-i think he &apos;s full of shit .
these public schools tend to hire well-@@ meaning but ultima@@ tely ...
- ... un@@ sophisti@@ cated burea@@ u@@ cra@@ ts .
-yeah . i don &apos;t like him .
but you might have to do it . just to please the school .
-i don &apos;t need it .
-i know .
and unfortunately , probably a guy with a ba in psycho@@ logy .
not a real shrin@@ k .
i have an ma in develo@@ p@@ mental psycho@@ logy ...
- ... from the y@@ ale child studies program .
-did you get a ph@@ .@@ d. ?
no , an ma is a master &apos;s .
right .
-@@ any thoughts about why you &apos;re here ?
-not really .
you said you wrote the song you played in asse@@ mb@@ ly .
-why ?
-i don &apos;t know .
did you have a reason ?
-i felt i could &apos;ve written it .
-okay .
but you didn &apos;t .
it was written by roger waters of pink flo@@ yd .
-i think you know that .
-but i felt i could &apos;ve .
so the fact that it was already written was kind of a techni@@ ca@@ lity .
i see .
i can imagine this is a little uncomfortable for you to talk about .
-i guess . it &apos;s hard to explain .
-i wonder how you &apos;re feeling right now .
i don &apos;t know .
why don &apos;t you tell me about something less uncomfortable .
like a nice memory , maybe .
isn &apos;t that a stock question for a shrin@@ k ?
yes . that &apos;s more or less how this works .
-i can &apos;t think of anything right now .
-just think .
-come on .
-just something .
meet me halfway here .
all right , let &apos;s see .
okay .
when i was around 6 , my mom and i du@@ cked out of julie g@@ lynn &apos;s birthday party to watch robin hood together on our tv .
that sounds like a nice memory .
-i liked er@@ ro@@ l f@@ lynn .
-@@ er@@ ro@@ l f@@ lynn .
-that &apos;s all ?
-and i was glad she let me leave the party to watch the movie .
she and i loved that movie .
it &apos;s like ....
_removed_
we &apos;d look at the knight armor at the met .
the scary fish at the natural history museum .
i was always afraid of the squ@@ id and the wh@@ ale fighting .
i could only look at it with my hands in front of my face .
when we &apos;d get home , after my bath , she &apos;d go through all the different things we saw that day at the museum .
and we &apos;d get to the squ@@ id and the wh@@ ale , and she &apos;d describe it for me .
which wa@@ s-- it was still scary but it was less scary .
anyway , it was fun . it was fun to hear about it .
did your dad live at home back then ?
-yeah , why ?
-you didn &apos;t mention him .
where was he during all of this ?
he was ....
i don &apos;t know exactly . he was ....
he was downstairs , maybe .
he didn &apos;t ever come to the museum . this was before my brother was born .
it was before ....
it was earlier .
hello ?
hello ?
-not now , bernard .
-why not ?
i &apos;m just not , okay ?
-@@ put me in your mouth .
-@@ walt !
-hi .
-hey , walt .
hi .
i &apos;ll be right out . we can hang out .
-hi . is walt here ?
-no .
i &apos;d like you to come to my house .
-@@ l@@ sn &apos;t it mom &apos;s night ?
-yeah , but i &apos;d like you to come over .
i have to put on my shoes .
come in , i guess .
-@@ place looks different .
-she got some new furniture in ma@@ ine .
that was my tv . i bought that tv .
that &apos;s my ju@@ de the ob@@ scu@@ re .
-@@ wanna take it ?
-no .
she still has some of the books you wrote .
dad , why are you taking me to your house on mom &apos;s night ?
just a minute .
hi .
frank let me in . i didn &apos;t realize you were here .
-i &apos;m here . it &apos;s monday .
-i &apos;d like to take him for just tonight .
i &apos;ll give you two thur@@ s@@ days in a row or something .
-@@ mom .
-it &apos;s my night . he wants to stay .
be careful . that &apos;s an anti@@ que .
-where &apos;s walt ?
-i don &apos;t know where walt is .
he &apos;s not up there . bernard !
he doesn &apos;t come here .
you should go . you &apos;ll see him tomorrow .
tell walt to call me .
i dun@@ ked my head in that pon@@ d in the park .
the one near the zoo ?
oh , sweetie , that &apos;s filthy .
i hope you didn &apos;t drink any of it .
some may have gotten in my mouth . i tried not to swallow .
i shouldn &apos;t have broken up with sophie .
-why did you ?
-i thought i could do better .
better how ?
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s good . you miss her .
but i don &apos;t see myself as a person who is in this situation . i just don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t see myself this way .
well , this is how it is .
did you ever love dad ?
because if you didn &apos;t , why did you ever marry him ?
if you were gonna leave , why put us through this ?
it wasn &apos;t planned . when we first met , he was unlike anyone .
in colum@@ bus , there was no one like your dad .
i had had an affair with a man before your father .
he worked at the book@@ store . we made love in the stock@@ room .
mom , i don &apos;t wanna hear about your affairs , please .
i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t know what i can say to you .
you say things in a way that i don &apos;t wanna hear them .
i know , chicken .
it &apos;s something i do . it &apos;s a bad habit .
do you remember when we watched robin hood ?
-he knocked on my window .
-@@ bernard , what are you doing ?
joan , let me ask you something .
the work i did at the end of our marriage making din@@ ners , being atten@@ tive .
-you were leaving .
-you never made a dinner .
i made bur@@ gers when you had p@@ neu@@ mon@@ ia .
-@@ only after i insisted .
-@@ lf i had made more din@@ ners ...
- ... would that have made a difference ?
-i was ready to leave long ago .
i just didn &apos;t know it then .
i &apos;ve been giving it some thought . you called my father at the last minute .
whatever you said , he thought i could save the marriage .
you felt i wasn &apos;t aggressive enough . i &apos;ll make more of an effort to do stuff .
i &apos;ve been cooking and doing cho@@ res at my house .
i make vea@@ l cu@@ t@@ lets , which the boys love .
why don &apos;t we all have dinner and talk more about this ?
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just ....
bur@@ gers .
i &apos;ll sue you , joan . you know i will .
you had an affair for four years with that fucking shrin@@ k that ruined our marriage .
eddie good@@ man works on these cases . and i have an open@@ -and-@@ shut case .
-@@ frank , walt , get in the car .
-@@ sue me ?
that &apos;s@@ -
- i can &apos;t--
you only wanted joint custody because you pay less child support that way .
because it &apos;s che@@ aper for you .
walt , frank !
-i don &apos;t wanna go .
-i don &apos;t give a shit ! get in the car .
-@@ frank !
-let him stay . let him stay .
-i &apos;m just asking this one thing .
-he wants to stay .
-let him . i &apos;ll go .
-@@ fine .
hold on .
you want him tonight ?
okay . thanks .
that &apos;s all right , my brother .
the cat !
i got him . joan , i got him .
i got him .
goddamn it .
-@@ dad ! you see him go@@ -- ?
-i &apos;m moving it !
fuck off .
whoa , bernard !
you all right ?
-i had him .
-@@ joan , call an ambulance !
walt , get in the car .
what ?
it means &quot; bitch . &quot; don &apos;t you remember ?
you &apos;re calling me a bitch ?
no , don &apos;t you remember the last line of god@@ ard &apos;s a bout de sou@@ ffle ?
bel@@ mon@@ do calls se@@ berg a bitch .
we saw it at the th@@ ali@@ a with the dick@@ ste@@ ins .
i got you in for the children &apos;s price . you were pregnant with walt .
like six weeks .
i still got you in for a children &apos;s ticket .
you told me you didn &apos;t like god@@ ard . you thought the jump cuts were@@ --
i &apos;d check for the cat behind the ash@@ cans ...
- ... under the go@@ lo@@ d@@ ners &apos; sto@@ op !
-okay .
i didn &apos;t write it .
-i know .
-@@ pink flo@@ yd did .
do you think we &apos;ll find him ?
i hope so .
do you think one day we could go to the gal@@ ap@@ agos ?
i don &apos;t know , pick@@ le .
ivan and i could take you to the country on saturday to see real tur@@ tles .
saturday is dad &apos;s day .
-there &apos;s my son .
-hey .
-are you okay ?
-i &apos;m fine .
thought it was a heart attack , but i think i &apos;m just exhausted .
doctor said i &apos;m exhausted .
-@@ too many vea@@ l cu@@ t@@ lets ?
-@@ maybe .
that a good book ?
oh , this is pul@@ p . it &apos;s not serious .
it &apos;s hard to read a good book in the hospital , but this isn &apos;t bad of its kind .
leonard is the fi@@ ll@@ et of the crime gen@@ re .
i &apos;d like you to stay here for the day . i need the company .
okay .
li@@ li moved out .
do me a favor , go out in the hall , get me another pillow .
my neck is hurting .
maybe we could even things out , and i could stay at mom &apos;s a few nights .
-i &apos;ve been staying more at yours .
-it &apos;s not a good time .
i &apos;m not gonna be 1 00 percent for a while . i &apos;d like you around .
-i don &apos;t wanna come for a while .
-it &apos;s not up to you .
you &apos;re a minor . you &apos;re in my custody . my home is your home too .
i &apos;m not coming .
why ?
that hurts my feelings .
don &apos;t be difficult .
if you like , we can get you some more pos@@ ters , make your room better .
paint it a different color .
i can lend you my first e@@ dition of the naked and the dead .
as a present .
let me get you a pillow .
you used to be very emotional when you were younger .
did i look pretty silly out there , falling on the con@@ cre@@ te ?
yeah .
what ? what are you laughing at ?
that was funny how you said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
-good comic timing .
-thanks .
why don &apos;t we get some breakfast .
see if you can find a nurse out there .
try to get the blond . she looks like a young monica vi@@ tti .
_removed_
the man in that room wants to order some breakfast .
okay .
my name is oliver queen . for 5 years ,
i was stran@@ ded on an island with only one go@@ al@@ -- survive .
oliver queen is alive .
to do this , i must become someone else .
i must become something else .
previously on &quot; arrow &quot; ...
feli@@ city , i want you to find out all you can about that note@@ book .
i &apos;ll be driving your mother around for a few days .
she &apos;s not a suspect .
oliver , something &apos;s going on in this city . you know it .
walter , please .
you &apos;ve got to stop looking into this . it &apos;s not safe .
well , acci@@ dents tend to be@@ fall people who are too curious .
and he won &apos;t be har@@ med ?
it &apos;s done . nor will ever discover your invol@@ vement . you have my word .
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m ready for the kind of commitment that you &apos;re looking for .
you can &apos;t be serious .
this is me serious , lau@@ rel .
call ca@@ yman fi@@ de@@ lity .
tell them their favorite accoun@@ tant is flying in to make a special deposit for a special client .
that elevator &apos;s supposed to be on a key . go .
check it out .
ha@@ ro@@ ld back@@ man , you have failed this city .
i &apos;m only an accoun@@ tant .
i &apos;m just the money .
the money that leads to ex@@ tor@@ tion , kidnapping , and drugs .
it &apos;s the destruction of innocent lives !
you think you scare me more than the people i work for ?
no .
they can deal with you .
let me guess .
some bad guy missing his fancy new laptop .
ha@@ ro@@ ld back@@ man . he &apos;s who star@@ ling city &apos;s worst call when they want to la@@ under money in the ca@@ y@@ mans .
shouldn &apos;t we just turn this over to ,
i don &apos;t know , the irs ?
just as soon as you return the money to the ri@@ ghtful owners .
well , it sounds like a very nice idea .
back@@ man &apos;s files are all protected with an asy@@ m@@ me@@ tric en@@ cry@@ ption al@@ gori@@ thm .
really ? so it &apos;s gonna take a while to break in .
days , at least .
better get started , then .
at the risk of ending up with an arrow in my eye , can i ask ...
when are you planning on making peace with di@@ ggle ?
he &apos;s the one who left , feli@@ city .
i did everything i could to stop him .
except apologize .
you promised you &apos;d help him track down flo@@ yd law@@ ton and then you--
made a choice that i can life with .
if he can &apos;t , then i don &apos;t need him .
i need to get back to the club .
oli@@ ver@@ --
let me know when you break in .
i wish someone would send me off to the ca@@ y@@ mans .
yes , i know it &apos;s been 6 months . but@@ --
i am very well aware of the sta@@ ti@@ stics .
but i haven &apos;t given up hope and neither should you .
that didn &apos;t sound too good .
_removed_
who were you talking to ?
just the insurance company .
they insist on paying out walter &apos;s life insurance policy .
i know we haven &apos;t talked about walter in a while , but i-@@ -i miss him , too .
it &apos;s like losing dad all over again .
you look radi@@ ant .
fla@@ tte@@ rer .
i think you &apos;re the last to arrive .
how &apos;s tommy ?
tommy is tommy . how &apos;s oliver ?
still in bed . it &apos;s only noon .
well , look who i just found .
get lost trying to find the house ?
you say that as if your dri@@ ve@@ way &apos;s not longer than most roads .
can i get anyone anything else ? frank ?
we &apos;re fine , dear , thank you .
_removed_
hello , mrs. queen . i &apos;m sorry to bother you at home .
oh , no , no . don &apos;t be silly , walter . come in , please .
you &apos;re here to see robert .
there &apos;s just some papers he needs to sign for the stock offering .
well , he &apos;s in some private meeting right now , but you &apos;re welcome to wait for him in his study .
thank you .
unless you &apos;d like to help me get my children out of the house .
you don &apos;t have children , do you , walter ?
not yet , i &apos;m afraid .
well , save yourself the trouble and don &apos;t .
they eventually all turn into teen@@ ag@@ ers .
adam hunt was re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant at first , but was more co@@ oper@@ ative upon being informed we knew about his em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement .
police communication system could use an up@@ grade .
i think mr. hunt can be persu@@ aded to make an anonymous don@@ ation .
well , that will certainly cure what ai@@ ls this city .
what &apos;s that , malcolm ?
we &apos;re emp@@ t@@ ying the atlan@@ tic with a tab@@ le@@ spoon .
for years we &apos;ve been for@@ cing the city &apos;s worst to do what is best , l@@ ever@@ age them to help us save the city .
but it &apos;s ... not working .
crime in the gla@@ des is rising .
the cancer is sp@@ reading .
we just need to ... take some more time .
did the man who raped frank &apos;s daughter give her any quarter ?
everyone in this room has lost something or someone to the gla@@ des .
and we have committed ourselves to fixing it .
but what have we truly accompli@@ shed ?
nothing .
maybe it &apos;s because the gla@@ des can &apos;t be fixed .
you &apos;re saying we should abandon the project ?
yes .
in favor of a new under@@ taking .
like ben tre in vietnam .
the village must be destroyed before it can be saved .
are you suggesting we somehow ... level the gla@@ des ?
down to the be@@ dro@@ ck .
only then can we truly re@@ build star@@ ling city and make it safer for everyone .
that &apos;s 24 square blocks .
and if we did@@ -- and i &apos;m not saying we shou@@ ld@@ -- if we did , wouldn &apos;t suspici@@ on fall on us ?
not if the destruction appears to be caused by a natural disaster .
you &apos;ve always had something of a god complex , malcolm .
it &apos;s part of your charm .
but even you can &apos;t create a natural disaster .
have you ever heard of uni@@ da@@ c industri@@ es ?
it &apos;s a small company .
they have an idea ...
an idea that will serve our pur@@ pos@@ es .
my sources tell me they &apos;re 5 years away from proto@@ type .
and any under@@ taking of value is worthy of patience .
and restra@@ int .
one man alone can &apos;t save this city , robert , and we both know that .
of all the gin jo@@ ints in all the to@@ wns in all the world , she walks into mine .
this coffee &apos;s terrible , oliver .
that &apos;s what you get for or@@ dering coffee in a bar .
you look tired .
too much work ?
too much crying .
tommy broke up with me .
what happened ?
i have no idea .
things were good . they were ...
great , and then suddenly he &apos;s packing up his things and telling me that it &apos;s over .
did he say anything to you ?
no . tommy and i haven &apos;t talked very much since he quit .
but he &apos;ll come around .
it &apos;s probably just cold feet .
like it was with you .
oliver , you don &apos;t sleep with your girlfriend &apos;s sister unless you &apos;re looking to blow the relationship up .
if you still want to be with tommy , do what we should have done .
talk to each other and be honest .
oliver , i need to show you what@@ --
i just totally walked in on a thing , didn &apos;t i ?
i &apos;m sorry , uh , who are you ?
nobody . i mean , i &apos;m not nobody .
i &apos;m someone , obviously .
and so are you . you &apos;re lau@@ rel , right ?
that lau@@ rel . gorgeous lau@@ rel .
this is feli@@ city . she &apos;s setting up my internet .
rou@@ ter . and i need to show oliver something very important related to it .
i &apos;ll let you go , then .
thank you for the coffee ... and the advice .
tell me you got in .
better . i ha@@ cked ca@@ yman fi@@ de@@ lity and put together a list all the depos@@ its back@@ man made last year .
feli@@ city , what good does that do us if we don &apos;t know whose money it was ?
look at the biggest deposit back@@ man made last year .

december 12 .
that &apos;s ...
the day walter disappeared .
what if one of back@@ man &apos;s clients was paid 2 million to kid@@ nap walter ?
then we find out which client it was ...
and we use them to find walter .
= = sync , corre@@ cted by el@@ der@@ man = =
ok , back@@ -@@ trace the account , follow the money , hopefully it will lead us to whoever kidnapped walter .
after all this time , do you think walter might still really be alive ?
i don &apos;t know .
got it .
domini@@ c al@@ on@@ zo . yeah .
name ring a bell ?
al@@ on@@ zo runs the biggest underground casino in star@@ ling city when he &apos;s not busy kidnapping .
he looks like the kind of low@@ life someone would hire to kid@@ nap walter .
how many arro@@ ws do you think you &apos;ll have to put in him before he gives up walter &apos;s location ?
say a lot ?
it &apos;s not that simple .
that casino has its own private army .
we need to access al@@ on@@ zo &apos;s computer , but without setting off any al@@ arms .
looks like we &apos;re gonna need all the help we can get .
it &apos;s too bad there &apos;s not someone else we could call .
that &apos;s enough . we can do this on our own .
well , then ... looks like someone &apos;s going gambling tonight .
those guys would make me the minute that i walked in there .
oliver queen would never be caught dead in a place like that .
i wasn &apos;t talking about you .
absolutely not .
i can count cards .
it &apos;s all probab@@ i@@ lity theory and mathe@@ ma@@ tics .
have you met me ?
bottom lin@@ e-@@ -i know my way around a casino .
feli@@ city , i &apos;m not letting you wal@@ k@@ --
the reason i joined you in the first place was to find walter , and for the first time , we have a real chance of finding him .
you have to let me do this .
all right .
but we do it my way .
come on .
i &apos;m sorry i had to pull you away from whoever you were meeting .
oh , it &apos;s nothing . everyone &apos;s left already .
besides , it &apos;s my fault for forgetting to sign the k-@@ 5@@ s this morning .
i hope you don &apos;t mind me asking , but is everything all right ?
just , uh , taking care of some odds and ends .
well , if ever you need a friendly ear .
you &apos;re a good man , walter .
i thought you &apos;d left .
i &apos;m still waiting for your answer .
how can you even think of doing this ?
that place took your soul , robert .
doing this won &apos;t give it back .
it won &apos;t bring back rebecca , either .
it still feels like yesterday , that day .
when she called my cell phone for the first time ,
i remember being anno@@ yed .
she knew i was busy , so i just let it ring .
when she called back a minute later ,
i shut my phone off .
a little after midnight , two sc@@ pd officers showed up in my office .
all i remember them saying was ...
she &apos;d been shot .
murdered in the gla@@ des .
after the cops left , i sat in my office the rest of the night listening to rebecca &apos;s messages .
she kept calling my name ...
asking for help ... until she was just stru@@ ggling to breathe , ga@@ sp@@ ing for air .
i listened to my wife die over and over and over again .
i can &apos;t imagine , malcolm .
try .
imagine it was mo@@ ira lying on that pa@@ vement , bleeding , calling your name .
and then tell me you wouldn &apos;t be prepared to do what i am .
what do you want ?
is that any way to treat a girl who just walked up 6 fli@@ ghts of stairs ?
no , it &apos;s not . where are my manners ? come on in .
thank you .
welcome .
did you do these ?
you know , feli@@ city ,
oliver and i don &apos;t need a relationship counselor .
that hasn &apos;t been my experience .
we have a lead on walter .
i need you to come back and help us find him .
oliver put you up to this ?
no .
he doesn &apos;t even know i &apos;m here .
look .
i know oliver didn &apos;t help you find your brother &apos;s killer and that hurts .
it sucks . but ...
you gotta know if it was your life on the line on not just your ...
very under@@ stand@@ able ven@@ de@@ tta , he would be there for you .
no hesi@@ tation .
and i don &apos;t want a part@@ ner@@ ship with those kind of quali@@ fi@@ cations , feli@@ city .
i know oliver &apos;s religi@@ ously against admi@@ tting he &apos;s wrong .
truth is , he needs you .
yeah .
and when oliver is ready to say that , he knows where i live .
sorry for bothering you .
it &apos;s no bother . i hope you find him .
wow , you really look like your father .
i never thought so before , but just now i saw him in you .
what are you doing here ?
we need to talk .
i said everything i have to say .
well , i haven &apos;t .
tommy , i love you , and i think that you still love me , so whatever problems that you think that we have ,
i know that if we face them toge@@ ther@@ --
you don &apos;t understand .
then help me understand .
if our relationship is gonna end , at least let it end with hone@@ sty .
ok , lau@@ rel .
honestly ...
you belong with oliver .
excuse me ?
he &apos;s still in love with you .
i have a meeting .
you ready ?
i think so .
just to be clear , the plan is for me to get caught counting cards in an underground casino filled with har@@ den@@ ed criminals .
so you can get a friendly warning from al@@ on@@ zo and plant a bug on his office computer .
right . which will hopefully lead us to walter .
that is assuming i get the friendly warning and not a bullet .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
yes , i do .
ok . if anything happens , i &apos;m right outside .
ok .

6 armed guards , 2 pit bos@@ ses , and a floor man .
how do you call yourself a casino without any lucky 7@@ s ?
stay focused , please .
i &apos;ll be with you the entire time .
thanks .
it feels really good having you inside me .
and by &quot; you , &quot; i mean your voice .
and by &quot; me , &quot; i mean my ear .
i &apos;m gonna stop talking right now .
that would be my pre@@ fe@@ rence .
one st@@ ack of high society , please .
thank you for stopping by .
of course .
uh , you said you had news .
it &apos;s ready .
the mar@@ kov device passed its final be@@ ta test this morning .
app@@ lied sci@@ en@@ ces is loading it on a truck bound for star@@ ling city as we speak .
well ...
congratulations are in order , then .
to both of us .
mo@@ ira , you may be surprised to know that i sometimes wa@@ ver in my convi@@ ctions .
but your friendship , your endless support ... always gives me the strength to carry on .
after all , you and i will always have a connection .
i &apos;m just sorry that robert &apos;s not here to celebrate with us .
i &apos;m sorry i had to take him from you .
if anyone &apos;s to blame for his death , it &apos;s me .
to robert .
to rebecca .
are you feeling all right ?
i know tonight was just another ted kor@@ d fun@@ d-@@ ra@@ iser , but you were surpri@@ sin@@ gly quiet .
mo@@ ira , there &apos;s something i need to talk to you about .
robert , if this is what i think it is ,
i don &apos;t want to know her name . i don &apos;t--
no , it &apos;s about malcolm .
he wants to level the gla@@ des .
and how does malcolm propose to evacu@@ ate an entire section of the city ?
he doesn &apos;t .
robert , that doesn &apos;t sound like you .
because i &apos;m not the man you think i am .
about a month before the opening of ste@@ e@@ le factory , the one in the gla@@ des ,
i was appro@@ ached by a local coun@@ ci@@ l@@ man .
he wanted money .
told me that &apos;s the way everything was done in the gla@@ des .
i told him i &apos;d never paid a bri@@ be in my life .
we got into an argument .
i didn &apos;t want to hurt him .
i swear , mo@@ ira .
but he fell .
oh , dear god .
oh , dear god .
the work i &apos;m doing with malcolm , with the list , it &apos;s my pen@@ ance , mo@@ ira .
what , so you &apos;ll at@@ one for one murder by commi@@ tting hundreds , thousands ?
robert .
you listen to me .
whatever wron@@ gs you &apos;ve committed , whatever mistakes you &apos;ve made , pre@@ ven@@ ting this horror is your chance to make it right .
please ...
please , robert , promise me you won &apos;t let this happen .
oh ! black@@ jack !
miss ...
can you come with me ?
is something wrong ?
get up .
oh , since you ask so nicely .
oh , there &apos;s the bathroom .
i should have known the manager &apos;s office would be down the hall and to the right of the bathroom .
mr. al@@ on@@ zo .
have a seat .
what &apos;s your name ?
me@@ gan .
do you know where the term &quot; 8@@ 6 &quot; comes from , me@@ gan ?
as it happens , i do . it &apos;s from pro@@ hibi@@ tion .
there was a-- an illegal casino , not like this one , located at 8@@ 6 bed@@ ford street in new york , and ...
god , you know , i &apos;m just gonna stop talking .
now it means to ban someone , someone who &apos;s cheating .
leave your chips and go .
thank you .
oh , yeah , me@@ gan , one more thing .
you see , the thing about card coun@@ ters is , uh ... sometimes they work ... with a partner .
you &apos;re gonna be really upset when you meet my partner .
i heard you never miss .
i don &apos;t .
where &apos;s walter ste@@ e@@ le ?
what ? what a you talking about , huh ?
6 months ago you had him kidnapped !
it was just a job . i was given a name .
i didn &apos;t ask any questions .
last chance .
where is he ?
below ground .
you &apos;re lying !
i delivered him and they killed him .
i heard the gun@@ shot .
he &apos;s dead .
oh , let &apos;s see that bl@@ ouse in that vio@@ let sha@@ de .
you &apos;re a miracle worker , the@@ a .
oh , when it comes to shopping , it &apos;s not work , really .
hey . i &apos;m teaching mom the jo@@ ys of online clothes shopping .
ollie ?
are you ok ?
i need to talk to you both .
what is it ?
it &apos;s about walter .
did the police contact you ?
one of mr. di@@ ggle &apos;s army buddies works for the fbi now .
and they got news tonight .
no .
i &apos;m very sorry .
no , no , no , no , no .
there must be some mistake .
who did mr. di@@ ggle talk to ? did they find a body ?
mom ...
walter &apos;s gone . no . this isn &apos;t right .
where are you going ?
_removed_
i need some air . it &apos;s 10 : 00 at night .
mom , you &apos;re in shock .
don &apos;t tell me what or how i feel , oliver .
why is she acting like that ?
come here .
i suspect i know what this is about .
you and i got in bed with malcolm to cure what ai@@ ls this city .
but i think you agree , killing thousands of people is not the answer .
indeed .
if we were to wa@@ ge a war with malcolm mer@@ lyn , we will lose .
my family has already suffered enough .
and i have no desire to en@@ danger mine .
fortunately , there &apos;s another option .
6 months ago , malcolm started buying up buildings in the gla@@ des through an off@@ shore company called sa@@ gi@@ tt@@ ari@@ us .
and he made it sound as if this under@@ taking of his was a recent inspi@@ ration .
if you &apos;re right , he has been thinking about this for months .
if he can &apos;t re@@ build it , he &apos;ll abandon the project .
how much of the gla@@ des does he already have ?
about a third .
now , if we can quietly buy up the rest before he can , he won &apos;t be able to gain the control he needs .
we will need capital .
do you still have your contacts in china ?
i already have a flight planned for shanghai tomorrow .
come with me .
we shouldn &apos;t travel together . malcolm might get worried .
he already knows i have my doubts .
besides , i &apos;m getting the ur@@ ge to take out the &quot; queen &apos;s gamb@@ it &quot;
for another vo@@ y@@ age .
dad ! do you have any cash ?
jerk pizza guy can &apos;t break a 100 .
hey . hi . waiting .
♪ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , tell me ...
pizza .
my hero .
i &apos;m star@@ ved .
yeah .
hey , ollie .
where do you keep the bottle open@@ er in this thing ?
bottom drawer .
did you talk to ray today ?
about the ski trip ?
no . he asked jean to move in with him last night .
oh . guess they &apos;ve been together forever .
we &apos;ve been together longer .
guess we have .
i only bring this up because your mom busted me yesterday .
and obviously we can &apos;t hang out at my house .
because your father threatened to ta@@ se me the last time that i closed the door to your bedroom ?
so wouldn &apos;t it be nice to have a little place of our own ?
yeah .
maybe . this is a little fast , lau@@ rel .
i know that you like to think of yourself as a bad boy , oliver queen , but ...
i feel like we &apos;re ready to take the next step .
yeah .
let &apos;s do it .
you lied to me .
we had a deal .
gon@@ g da@@ g .
what are you talking about ?
you promised if i co@@ oper@@ ated with the under@@ taking , walter wouldn &apos;t be har@@ med !
_removed_
and i know ...
i know you &apos;ve had him killed .
turn on the camera .
oh , walter ...
like you said , mo@@ ira , we have an agreement .
walter would stay in my custody until the under@@ taking was complete .
we &apos;re both in this together .
i &apos;ve been sitting in the dark all day , too .
all these months i kept thinking if i could find a clue , i could get a lead on him .
guess it wouldn &apos;t have ma@@ ttered .
i can &apos;t imagine what your family &apos;s going through .
walter &apos;s alive .
what ?
but al@@ on@@ zo sai@@ d--
i need you to pull up malcolm mer@@ lyn &apos;s phone records .
he made a call from his office to wherever walter is being kept at 10 : 30 p.@@ m .
malcolm mer@@ lyn ?
tommy &apos;s father ?
why would he kid@@ nap walter ?
l.@@ u.@@ d. showed he made a call to a ten@@ ement complex located in blu@@ d@@ haven .
can you pull up a satellite view ?
ok .
that &apos;s a lot of security for low-@@ income hou@@ sing .
there &apos;s two guards sta@@ tioned at all access points .
there &apos;s just one on the roof . exactly . there &apos;s no other buildings in that area .
if you want to get onto the roof , you &apos;re going to have to jump off of something .
there &apos;s a problem in qu@@ ad@@ rant 4 .
mr. ste@@ e@@ le .
walter .
what ?
what &apos;s happening ?
you &apos;re going home .
i thought i &apos;d never see you again .
i &apos;m all right .
welcome home , walter .
thank you , son .
the@@ a .
this is totally a family thing , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m sorry , who are you ?
this is feli@@ city .
she &apos;s my friend .
mine , too .
it &apos;s good to see you .
you , too .
i &apos;ll let you guys get back to your hu@@ gging .
oliver .
we &apos;re all together again .
everything &apos;s gonna be all right .
robert , i don &apos;t like the idea of this .
it &apos;s gonna be ok .
yeah , well , how long will you be gone ?
a few weeks . maybe more , depending on what i--
why can &apos;t you just fly to china ?
i think it &apos;s better the less you know .
i just hate that stupid boat .
look at me .
i love you .
everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
ok .
got room for one more ?
no .
mom , let me keep dad company .
oliver , you &apos;re in school .
not really .
i tried to tell you that .
i could use an extra hand on the ship .
robert ...
mo@@ ira , let the kid take the boat out with the old man .
all right .
all right .
but you promise me that you &apos;ll behave yourself .
all right . i promise .
i love you so much .
i love you , too .
i totally sp@@ ac@@ ed .
i gotta call tommy and let him know
i &apos;m out of town for a few weeks .
i &apos;ll see you on board in 5 .
sara ? you here ?
yeah , you might want to circle around the block a few times , because your sister just showed up .
hi . what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re leaving for 3 weeks .
i wanted to come say bye to you in person .
i &apos;m glad you did .
and ...
i wanted to bring you something .
in case you get lonely at sea .
thank you .
hey , is everything ok ?
i mean , i didn &apos;t totally freak you out when i brought up the whole apartment thing earlier , did i ?
no .
good .
no .
but i do have to get back to the boat .
yeah .
is it done ? yes .
the bomb is in place .
and there &apos;s a storm front moving in along the &quot; gamb@@ it &apos;s &quot; proje@@ cted course .
ok .
when the &quot; queen &apos;s gamb@@ it &quot; goes down , no one will suspect it &apos;s anything other than an act of god .
oliver .
ah . what a miracle .
how &apos;s walter ?
the police are saying that he was rescu@@ ed by the vi@@ gi@@ lan@@ te .
yes , he was .
has he said anything about his or@@ deal ?
was he able to identify any of his cap@@ tors ?
no .
that &apos;s too bad .
they &apos;ll get what &apos;s coming to them .
i &apos;m just glad that my family is back together .
we all are .
ollie .
excuse me .
is walter ok ?
i saw it on the news .
yeah .
are you ok ?
of course .
i promise you now is not the time .
it &apos;s you and tommy .
you and me , actually .
i talked to tommy yesterday , and the reason he broke up with me is because he thinks that you and i still belong together .
what did you say ?
nothing .
he walked out on me .
i just want you to be happy .
it &apos;s what i &apos;ve always wanted .
then will you please go talk to tommy for me ?
and say what ?
say that you and i are over .
that you &apos;re not still in love with me .
i can &apos;t do that .
why not ?
because it wouldn &apos;t be true .
and i have enough lies in my life already .
i guess you do know where i live .
i &apos;ve always known where you live .
may i ?
i &apos;m sorry .
you were right .
and i was wrong .
about dead@@ shot ?
about everything .
about my mother and about her invol@@ vement in the under@@ taking .
she lied to me .
to the@@ a .
she &apos;s working with malcolm mer@@ lyn .
they &apos;re planning something .
something ...
terrible .
i don &apos;t know what yet .
but i just know one thing .
i need your help to stop them .

good evening , everyone .
we didn &apos;t have many days of laugh@@ ter this year .
standing at the finish line of the nin@@ e@@ ties , we all had high hopes for this year .
we stru@@ gg@@ led hard against the tide of change around the world , and within our country ,
- it was a year that deman@@ ded

we wake up and realize our fa@@ ul@@ ts as we face

the beginning of the twenty-@@ first century .
- now , d@@ b@@ c news will begin .

eigh@@ teen . just a little more .
we declare war against crime and violence ...
yes , it &apos;s been a long time since our president seemed so tru@@ st@@ won &apos;@@ thy .
however , despite his ambi@@ tions and de@@ clar@@ ations , this was a ban@@ ner year for crime .
bri@@ e@@ fly said , it was a crisis for public welfare .
in the year ahead ,
i hope the average joe will be able to keep the smile on his face .
trust you , sir ?
believe me , we &apos;d like to .
voice of a murderer
- hey , look sharp up there .
- min@@ -@@ sun ...
- min@@ -@@ sun !
- we haven &apos;t taken a picture yet !
in this case , the suspect was someone that knew the family , and when he didn &apos;t get the ransom ,
yo@@ o min@@ -@@ sun he cho@@ ked the child to death and buried her body .
so this case shows how kidn@@ app@@ ers that destroy families are always nail , always brought to justice .
yes , now we can &apos;t even send our kids to school with peace of mind .
mr. president wants our trust , but the world is in chaos .
the police are working very hard , but it seems they need to work harder .
what good is it to catch the criminal , when min@@ -@@ sun was taken away screaming and returned cold and life@@ less ?
crime is beyond the reach of the law .
must forensi@@ c science also be out of our reach ?
madam , would you please open the door ?
late again , like any other day .
look at what time it is .
ah , home sweet home .

oh , you don &apos;t like it ?

the presu@@ mption is that he was su@@ f@@ fo@@ cated , possibly one day after he was kidnapped .

i hope they catch the man that killed san@@ g-@@ woo .
san@@ g-@@ woo .
although the police condu@@ cted a secret investigation , they still have no clu@@ es as to the identity of the criminal .
the police must determine what , and who , caused a young , hope@@ ful boy to return home in a body bag after these 4@@ 4 days of terror .
- director han , we &apos;ve got 3 seconds .

the actual killer , recorded in 199@@ 1 . please listen very carefully .
i gave him pills because he was coming down with a cold , and he &apos;s sleeping now .
anyway ...
please open the back seat once and leave the inside lights on .
the back seats .
leave the door open , and leave the trunk open .
then , you can go into the ba@@ k@@ ery and wait there .
you need to leave the keys inside .
the killer is believed to be a male , open the trunk .
with an average build , approximately 5 &apos; 6 &quot; to 5 &apos; 7 &quot; tall open it up all the way .
and then close it and speaks with a seoul and g@@ ye@@ on@@ gg@@ i pro@@ vince di@@ ale@@ ct . then come straight to the domestic termin@@ al at the airport .
he was believed to be in his early to mi@@ d-@@ thir@@ ties you have very little dev@@ o@@ tion to your child .
at the time of the crime ( 199@@ 1 ) . someone was sitting in the back seat .
i &apos;m telling you , there was someone in the back seat .
ma &apos;am , then you will have to come yourself .
to be honest , i just don &apos;t trust your husband .
you need to understand this .
and don &apos;t bring other people into this .
the 199@@ 1 kidnapping and murder of lee hy@@ ung-@@ ho . what is your decision ?
more than 100,000 members of the police force have been you know that this isn &apos;t what is best for hy@@ ung-@@ ho ?
assigned to this case over the course of the past 16 years . you want hy@@ ung-@@ ho to die , don &apos;t you ?
over 4@@ 20 suspects were arrested and investiga@@ ted . know that today is the end .
8@@ 7 voice recor@@ dings and hand@@ writing samples have been analy@@ zed .
as of january , 200@@ 6 , the statu@@ te of limi@@ tions i have your son ?
has ex@@ pi@@ red on the case .
as of 200@@ 7 , the murderer still walks free .
in memory of the late lee hy@@ ung-@@ ho . may his soul rest in peace .
previously on nikita .
operation pale fire .
division col@@ labor@@ ated with serge@@ i se@@ ma@@ k to kill niko@@ la@@ i u@@ din@@ ov and his family .
i saved the daughter , alex@@ andra .
your partner ?
that &apos;s why she &apos;s working with you to take down the division .
- her focus has shi@@ fted . - revenge .
that &apos;s where i &apos;m going ... to get the man who ordered my parents to die .
and i &apos;m going to kill him .
mom ?
the guar@@ di@@ ans ... they &apos;re gathering , and percy is behind it .
we don &apos;t know if anything is happening with percy , but what we do know is that ari has the box .
i &apos;ll go after the guardian . you go after ari .
and you &apos;ll be fine with him . no .
michael goes with you .
you &apos;re chasing ari ta@@ sa@@ ro@@ v into the heart of go@@ go@@ l territory .
you don &apos;t even know where he &apos;s headed .
yeah , she does .
i put a tr@@ ack@@ er on his car . i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m going to find there , but it &apos;s the right thing to do .
hello , ari .
operation pale fire ...
background is need@@ -to-@@ know .
this is the target zone .
papa bear , mama bear , and baby bear .
our man on the inside has provided exten@@ sive intel to the la@@ you@@ t of the home and all the security mea@@ sures that are in place .
papa bear likes to maintain a se@@ mb@@ lance of nor@@ mal@@ cy for his family , so the estate grounds will be far more heavily guar@@ ded than inside the house itself .
patro@@ ls will be shi@@ fted to the north , so you will come up through the woods from the south , up the drive , and into the front door .
current alarm codes will be in your brief@@ ing pack@@ et .
review the material , be ready in two hours .
dismissed .
ro@@ an , stay back a minute .
is there a problem ?
how ?
how ?
mama ...
i thought you were dead .
they said , &quot; mother down . &quot;
niko@@ la@@ i ... he heard men downstairs ...
shooting . he left me .
i can &apos;t remember .
i saw a gun .
i woke up in hospital .
you were dead .
everyone was dead .
someone took me .
she saved my life .
bingo . - what &apos;s that ? - up@@ date from nikita .
looks like the tr@@ ack@@ er you put on ari ta@@ sa@@ ro@@ v &apos;s car worked .
i know you guys want to replace the box you lost , but ... maybe she should just let it go .
we can &apos;t let ari keep that box .
if he finds a way to de@@ cry@@ pt it , i don &apos;t want to think about what he &apos;d do with those dirty secrets .
you should be with her .
i could &apos;ve tracked this guardian on my own .
he &apos;s going to meet up with the other guar@@ di@@ ans .
you want to take on all three by yourself ?
no . nikita was right .
we got to grab that box and then figure out what the guar@@ di@@ ans are up to ...
what percy &apos;s up to .
what &apos;d you find ?
i nar@@ ro@@ wed it down to these six ho@@ tels .
those are some nice places .
i thought the guar@@ di@@ ans were more &quot; bed of nails &quot; and all .
easier to get lost in a crowd at a big hotel .
these are the right size , near public transpor@@ tation , with multiple points of e@@ gress .
okay , so we zero him down , track him to the gathering , and figure out how percy &apos;s pulling the strings .
- why are you still in london ?
- excuse me ?
nikita says you &apos;re staying in london to be with the kid .
is that gonna be a permanent thing or ... ? whoa .
why is she even talking to you about this ?
she needs to talk to somebody .
it &apos;s getting harder for her .
maybe she can &apos;t talk to you &apos; cause she thinks she already lost you .
- she hasn &apos;t .
- i know .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m warning you .
you need to make a choice before someone makes it for you .
and who &apos;s gonna make that for me ...
you ?
i don &apos;t have a kid .
you killed her fi@@ ance .
yeah . nikita said he was a nice , normal guy ...
didn &apos;t deserve to die ...
neither did emily .
she was innocent , just like your son .
she died because of me , because that &apos;s what happens when normal people get sucked into our world .
they get hurt .
mama , have you been here all these years ...
in this house ?
i have to hide .
no one can know that i &apos;m in here .
are you all right ?
i heard voices downstairs . what &apos;s happening ?
i &apos;m atten@@ ding to some business .
why are you so nervous ?
whenever i hear too many voices downstairs , - it makes me think of the men who ...
- who cannot hurt you now .
the house is protected . no one knows you &apos;re here .
i don &apos;t need that .
let &apos;s not go through this again , kat@@ ya .
you need some rest .
take the pill .
i should &apos;ve killed se@@ ma@@ k when i had the chance .
_removed_
- it &apos;s okay , mama .
i understand now .
se@@ ma@@ k was always jealous of papa .
he always wanted everything papa had , so he took it .
he can have ze@@ tro@@ v , but he can &apos;t have you ...
not anymore .
i just don &apos;t understand .
i have to leave for a few minutes , but i &apos;ll be right back .
just stay here .
crap .
hello , ryan .
how are you feeling today ? more co@@ oper@@ ative ?
if this is about over@@ sight ...
i need to neutra@@ lize them now , in a way that doesn &apos;t raise questions or leave evidence to trace back to me .
i &apos;ve given you their identi@@ ties . you &apos;ve had a while to think .
i kept you alive because i thought you might be useful , but if i was wrong ...
then i should correct my mistake .
i told you ...
the only way i can help is if i know everything on division , over@@ sight ...
even the details you don &apos;t think are relevant .
you know ...
today is your lucky day .
i &apos;m gonna have to take you to the files .
they don &apos;t transport well .
so , now you want to take down over@@ sight .
and your big hope is the little li@@ bra@@ rian .
that &apos;s just sad .
i need some l@@ ever@@ age to keep the lights on around here .
bringing down over@@ sight is something we all want ...
you , me ...
even the li@@ bra@@ rian here .
remind me ... what &apos;s in it for me ?
fine .
i &apos;ll give you your things back , if you give him something useful .
how about i give him the mercy of a quick death ?
well , that wouldn &apos;t be very polite , would it ?
yeah ? what are you gonna do about it ...
kill me ?
three words , percy ... medi@@ cally indu@@ ced coma .
consider the consequences .
play nice .
what a bitch , right ?
why are you here ?
ari ta@@ sa@@ ro@@ v has a black box .
i &apos;m here to steal it back .
so your plan is to cut the power , let everyone freak and grab the box in the chaos ?
that was the ...
yeah .
- careful .
- can &apos;t let you do that ...
not without screwing up my plan to rescue my mother .
she &apos;s alive , nikita . she &apos;s upstairs .
- your mother ? how ? - i don &apos;t know .
but if i &apos;m gonna get her out , no one can know we &apos;re here .
where are we with the box ?
well , we think we found a way around the bio@@ me@@ tri@@ cs lock , but the data en@@ cry@@ ption may take weeks to break .
i &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
percy is nothing if not paranoid .
it &apos;s one of his few admi@@ rable quali@@ ties .
keep on it .
mr. abra@@ mo@@ v , did you receive the photograph i sent you ?
it &apos;s her ... the girl who bought my weapons .
she &apos;s here in russia .
tell no one else . i &apos;ll take care of it .
yes , mr. ta@@ sa@@ ro@@ v ?
increase patro@@ ls on the estate immediately , then come up to the house .
i &apos;d like to discuss the perimeter breach we spoke of earlier .
i have to dis@@ able the alarm .
let me sneak her out , then i &apos;ll go .
_removed_
look , you can blow up this damn house , for all i care , after i know she &apos;s safe .
what are you doing ?
when he mi@@ sses the next che@@ ck-@@ in , they &apos;re gonna know something &apos;s wrong .
i got a plan .
the black box can wait .
we &apos;re gonna get your mother out ...
tonight .
nothing on the hotel guest list matches our guardian .
well , that &apos;s our fourth strike .
that &apos;s a guardian .
not that i should say this , but ...
i kind of wish you were still on the regi@@ men .
so do i .
is that a bad thing ?
he &apos;s picking up his shirts ?
he &apos;s at a four-@@ star hotel .
why would he send his shirts out for cleaning ?
percy loved all that cold war spy crap ...
dead drops and code words and ...
in two hours , he &apos;s gonna be at the dry clean@@ er &apos;s .
maybe then we &apos;ll find out where the meeting is .
once we do , i &apos;m pretty sure we got a way inside .
so i &apos;ll go in the way i did before ...
through the cellar and up the laundry chu@@ te , which puts me here ...
right outside the bedroom door .
i &apos;ll take my mother down the back stairs , and if you wait at this door , we can take the guards out then .
it should buy us enough time before they realize there &apos;s a breach .
you &apos;re missing something .
how do we get off the estate ?
we both got here on foot through the woods .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s an option for your mother .
we have to steal a car .
but that could draw too much attention .
depends on the car .
- ari &apos;s here , right ?
- yeah .
he &apos;s got his own car and driver .
only an insane go@@ go@@ l agent would try and stop ari ta@@ sa@@ ro@@ v &apos;s car .
how do we know which car is his ?
ari &apos;s driver never leaves the car , for security reasons .
i &apos;ll deal with him , get behind the wheel ...
- if they follow us ...
- they won &apos;t .
i &apos;m going to dis@@ able all the other cars .
it &apos;s a little trick michael taught me .
if you can delay your enemy for even a few minutes ...
it might be enough to win the day . you taught me that .
thank you ...
for helping us .
don &apos;t thank me yet .
has anyone missed their scheduled che@@ ck-@@ ins ?
no , sir . they &apos;ve all reported in .
_removed_
i want you to go out personally and check with your own eyes that everyone is at their pos@@ ts .
yes , sir .
i have new information with regar@@ ds to ms. u@@ din@@ ov .
i believe she &apos;s here ...
somewhere on the property .
amanda thinks that you &apos;re going to be able to come up with the sche@@ me to dis@@ man@@ tle over@@ sight , huh ?
- that off@@ ends you ?
- it does , yeah .
i mean , i had them under control .
and then they got to amanda ...
and she got inti@@ mi@@ dated .
now she &apos;s running into the ground everything you took years to build ...
well ...
you and over@@ sight .
_removed_
division was mine . it was my concept .
snap out of it .
mama , mama ...
i found us a way out . it &apos;s time to go .
- mama , it &apos;s okay .
- no !
welcome home , alex@@ andra .
i &apos;ve heard so much about you .
it is a pleasure to finally make your acqua@@ int@@ ance .
well , you &apos;ll understand that i can &apos;t say the same .
_removed_
i &apos;ve heard that percy is being held prisoner inside division .
have you seen him ?
yes , let &apos;s talk about percy .
i &apos;m curious why he saved you .
and what was he planning to do with you ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you were supposed to die , yet here you are .
why would division spare your life ?
percy never struck me as a soft touch .
oh , my god .
that story yuri told about me being bra@@ in@@ washed ...
that wasn &apos;t just some cover story .
you actually thought it was true .
i thought it was quite a brilliant plan .
i &apos;m sorry to dis@@ appoint .
division didn &apos;t rescue me that night ... nikita did .
_removed_
that is the ...
ro@@ gue agent , yes . she is a soft touch .
i in@@ fil@@ tra@@ ted division .
i wanted to make percy pay .
mission accompli@@ shed . he &apos;s in a hole .
my new mission is to kill you .
your mission has failed , alex@@ andra .
night &apos;s not over yet .
that &apos;s enough . you know where to take her .
7 o &apos;clock .
i think this is our guy .
i seem to have mi@@ sp@@ lac@@ ed my ticket .
what are you picking up ?
three shirts ... blue ...
ligh@@ tly star@@ ched and pressed , bo@@ xed .
this isn &apos;t a clue to the meeting .
this is the meeting .
i say we bomb the place ...
no more guar@@ di@@ ans , no more black boxes .
this meeting is our only chance at figu@@ ring out what percy &apos;s up to .
last time he had a big secret plan , he tried to level the seventh floor of the cia .
so you &apos;re gonna walk in there , alone , and meet with two guar@@ di@@ ans ?
we barely managed to take down one of them together .
i &apos;m not going in alone .
we &apos;ll be on com@@ ms , and that box is my backup .
- be ready when i give the word .
- i got ya .
i seem to have mi@@ sp@@ lac@@ ed my ticket .
what are you picking up ?
three shirts ... blue ...
ligh@@ tly star@@ ched and pressed , bo@@ xed .
you &apos;re the other guardian ?
when did that happen ?
i thought you were percy &apos;s righ@@ t-@@ hand man .
that &apos;s why he chose me .
thanks to nikita , you guys were dropping like flies , and percy wanted extra insurance .
right before amanda took over , he gave me a box and told me to run .
i don &apos;t believe you .
then i &apos;ll prove it to you .
can &apos;t believe he didn &apos;t tell us .
well , things happened pretty fast that day .
are we missing a box ?
i see only two , but there are three of us .
did you lose something ?
how &apos;d you go from over@@ sight &apos;s golden boy to its chief ex@@ tor@@ tion@@ er ?
down@@ side of being invisible ?
lack of visi@@ bility .
running this place , you &apos;ve become a deni@@ able ass@@ et ...
someone who could be wiped away if he stepped out of line .
you needed l@@ ever@@ age .
that &apos;s what the black boxes are for .
but there had to be a catal@@ y@@ st ?
some incident that sou@@ red your relationship with over@@ sight .
well , that reached critical mass with operation pale fire .
in 200@@ 5 , a russian con@@ glo@@ mer@@ ate ... ze@@ tro@@ v ...
refu@@ sing to do business with the united states .
it was a threat to national security ?
over@@ sight saw it as a threat to financial security ...
the@@ irs , in particular ...
so they came to me .
and i discovered that the ce@@ o &apos;s number two ...
a man named serge@@ i se@@ ma@@ k ... might be pli@@ able .
you turned him ...
plo@@ tted with him to kill ze@@ tro@@ v &apos;s foun@@ der ... niko@@ la@@ i u@@ din@@ ov , alex &apos;s father .
i know the back@@ story .
it was se@@ ma@@ k &apos;s idea to kill the family .
he said that if he could have control , he would be our man on the inside ...
ex@@ p@@ and u.s. interests throughout his he@@ mi@@ sp@@ here .
that &apos;s a pretty big promise .
exactly what i said .
i said he couldn &apos;t be trusted , and i was right .
- he took over ...
- and re@@ ne@@ ged on the deal .
yeah . they want to blame me for it .
now , amanda and over@@ sight think that alex is going to take over ze@@ tro@@ v .
well , that ain &apos;t gonna happen .
she &apos;s going to kill se@@ ma@@ k and plun@@ ge the company into complete chaos .
amanda has lost control of her girl .
history does tend to repeat itself .
you say that that mission was when everything went side@@ ways with over@@ sight .
no . no , the real threat wasn &apos;t for@@ ming over your head .
it was happening right under your nose .
pale fire was the first time nikita ever diso@@ be@@ yed orders .
she rescu@@ ed alex that night ...
her first strike against division ...
and the first step of your journey ... right into this cage .
you sent nikita on that mission ... and sealed your own fate .
how bad is it ?
looks worse than it is .
take this , okay ?
what are you doing ?
wait for my call .
i want you to tell kat@@ ya who i am .
you &apos;re going back ?
i told you , we &apos;re getting your mom out tonight .
guar@@ di@@ ans ...
did everyone make it ?
three guar@@ di@@ ans ... present .
open your pac@@ kets .
vi@@ su@@ ally confirm each other &apos;s identity .
maintain security profile alpha .
we ren@@ de@@ z@@ vous in new york in two days .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m not a guardian .
i &apos;m just a guy who ri@@ gged a black box with explosives .
don &apos;t stop until we get to bru@@ s@@ sel@@ s , just to be safe .
i &apos;m not slo@@ wing down till this thing runs out of gas .
nikita hasn &apos;t called me back .
it &apos;s been a while .
who are you ?
i &apos;m a friend of your daughter &apos;s .
i &apos;m here to get you out .
okay ?
here ...
talk to her .
you will get her killed .
no , she &apos;s safe .
i saved her from ari &apos;s men .
i made her safe .
i told serge@@ i she was here ... not ari .
my alex@@ andra is sick , very sick .
- yes .
- mr. ta@@ sa@@ ro@@ v ...
we have two guards down at the back of the house .
secure mr. se@@ ma@@ k .
do not leave his side until i tell you otherwise .
have your men sweep the entire house .
someone else is here . find them .
the americans took her , and they filled her head with lies ...
lies about serge@@ i .
now she wants to kill him ?
serge@@ i wants your daughter dead .
no .
no , he wants to help her .
we want to put her someplace safe where the doctors can come and heal the damage done to her mind , make her see the truth .
you want to know the truth ?
he hired the americans to wipe out your family so he could take control of ze@@ tro@@ v .
this is a lie .
i was there , kat@@ ya .
i was on the strike team . we had everything .
we had alarm codes . we had floor plans .
we had security patrol schedu@@ les ... all given to us by se@@ ma@@ k .
_removed_
i killed your husband .
no , serge@@ i loves me .
he wanted ze@@ tro@@ v , and he wanted you .
he had me .
we had each other .
you were having an affair .
that &apos;s why you survived that night .
it was part of his deal with percy , wasn &apos;t it ?
right now you come with me .
i &apos;m not asking .
- let &apos;s go . - okay .
you feeling better ?
i don &apos;t feel anything now ...
if that &apos;s what you want to know .
you were screaming and tea@@ ring the room apart .
you could have hurt yourself . i had to do something .
i &apos;ve lost her again .
now she &apos;ll never come back to me .
let &apos;s hope not .
_removed_
you won &apos;t hurt her .
we had a deal .
she and her associate killed half of my men .
i cannot let that stand .
you promised not to hurt alex@@ andra .
but she &apos;s not your alex@@ andra anymore , kat@@ ya .
you must see that now .
i see many things now .
living down here , i &apos;ve had time to refle@@ ct .
you know what i &apos;ve come to realize ?
you like your refle@@ ction .
i &apos;ve seen that i &apos;ve made mistakes .
but that i can also learn from them .
sometimes all you need is a s@@ light shift in perspective to bring things into focus .
you have had time to refle@@ ct .
i &apos;ve also had time to plan .
against over@@ sight ?
i told you , they &apos;re ir@@ relevant .
as you said , there &apos;s always a group behind the group .
if you look close , you &apos;ll see there &apos;s a door up there .
where could you possibly go ?
to a higher place ...
not the place you &apos;re thinking of .
i think the phone &apos;s a dead end .
- well , we know they &apos;re headed home .
- and ro@@ an &apos;s running things .
he &apos;s how percy &apos;s communi@@ cating with them .
we were his insurance policy .
- what ?
- the guar@@ di@@ ans .
we were the thing that kept percy alive .
but percy planned for every contin@@ gency .
in the event of his death , we were to up@@ load the boxes .
maybe in the event of his capture ...
you break him out .
i &apos;ll stay home until you get here , and we &apos;ll figure out the percy stuff then .
owen thinks we should let him escape and then shoot him .
that &apos;s not a bad idea ...
although we &apos;d probably fight over who got to shoot him first .
and we should talk ... about us and ... where we stand .
i &apos;ll be here .
you don &apos;t have to go on this one .
i can talk to percy and find another agent for pale fire ...
maybe kelly .
she &apos;d love that .
i &apos;d never hear the end of it .
_removed_
i know you hate these kinds of mi@@ ssions ...
with civilians .
it &apos;s important to percy , right ?
it &apos;ll be good for me to go .
you &apos;re a capable agent .
you don &apos;t have to prove that to him anymore .
you once told me that division was a second chance ...
an opportunity to be a new person , make a difference .
this mission ...
this is how i prove to myself what kind of person i &apos;ve become .
you know , for years , i &apos;ve had ... these memories to hold on to ...
an image in my head of what i &apos;d lost .
no matter how bad things got , i could close my eyes , and ...
they were there .
that &apos;s what got you through .
but it was a lie .
and now i can &apos;t even trust my own memories .
her and se@@ ma@@ k ...
i never had a clue .
you were a kid who loved her parents .
i &apos;ve wasted so much time and energy ...
a@@ ven@@ ging what ?
a father that loved me , but wasn &apos;t innocent and ... a mother that ...
- maybe never loved me at all . - alex ...
i don &apos;t understand kat@@ ya &apos;s choices , but i do think that she loves you .
you can &apos;t know that .
she could &apos;ve been in on se@@ ma@@ k &apos;s plan all along .
no , i think that she &apos;s mis@@ gui@@ ded and not facing reality .
but when she said that she wanted to keep you safe , i believed her .
she was afraid of losing you .
she was more afraid of losing him .
i don &apos;t know how to get past that .
you don &apos;t have to figure it all out right now .
don &apos;t give up on her ...
not yet .
i heard you ...
on the phone .
even after you knew what she did , you still tried to reach her .
people make mistakes .
you know , they make bad choices .
and then to make up for them , they make even worse ones .
but if you give them a second chance , sometimes they surprise you .
yeah .
sometimes they do .

what ?
nothing , it &apos;s just ... so sad .
claire .
we both knew exactly what she was .
yes , i know , she was the bi@@ tchy side character .
hm ?
sorry .
-go . -oh .
but , se@@ th , suicide ?
a character like ga@@ -in , she would have killed joon , not herself .
plus , the exact same way mr. park died , which was a murder .
this isn &apos;t real life , this is a k-@@ drama , so whoever killed mr. park killed ga@@ -in , right ?
this isn &apos;t one of those dra@@ mas , claire .
this isn &apos;t a mystery , it &apos;s romance .
it was supposed to be a romance .
you look really nice , by the way . all like pressed and clean .
very , like , man@@ ly .
that &apos;s nice of you to say .
you look very nice yourself .
well , it is a funeral .
we &apos;re sorry for your loss .
thank you for coming .
now , this isn &apos;t real life , this is a k-@@ drama , so whoever did it to mr. park and ga@@ -in , they &apos;d be here for the memorial .
extra , extra ...
se@@ o-@@ ye@@ on , no .
mrs. park ... oh , maybe .
-@@ claire .
-what ?
it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t appreciate all your sle@@ u@@ thing here , but i don &apos;t think this is the time and place .
i don &apos;t know what else to do !
- your boyfriend &apos;s not here .
- joon &apos;s not my boyfriend .
don &apos;t you think that that &apos;s odd he &apos;s not here ?
don &apos;t you think that that &apos;s , i don &apos;t know , a little suspicious ?
the fiancé of the de@@ ceased is the only re@@ cur@@ ring character that &apos;s missing ?
i don &apos;t know .
where the hell is he ?
keep this safe !
all of north korea &apos;s ato@@ mic missile secrets are inside . no , no !
_removed_
i have my own problems .
hey !
are you okay ?
she and i were never going to be best friends ,
but if i &apos;d known this was going to happen ...
i &apos;m so sorry ...
don &apos;t cry , se@@ o-@@ ye@@ on .
i feel so sorry ...
you have no reason to feel that way .
if anyone has a reason to feel guilty , it &apos;s park joon for not being here .
se@@ th !
not now .
dad , i &apos;m sorry i never got a chance to say goodbye .
you , too , ga@@ -in . i would have liked to cook for you .
ki@@ m@@ chi fried rice
dad , remember how you used to cook for me ?
let &apos;s at least share one last meal together .
- se@@ th .
- hm ?
i keep asking myself over and over , who bene@@ fi@@ ted from mr. park &apos;s death ?
who bene@@ fits from ga@@ -in &apos;s death ?
and there &apos;s only one answer .
what if i was all wrong and joon &apos;s the murderer ?
joon ? the murderer ?
well , think about it .
his father wanted him to inher@@ it the company . dead .
ga@@ -in was trying to force him to marry her . dead .
- but he &apos;s the leading man .
- who else could it possibly be ?
se@@ th !
i don &apos;t have time for your revenge fanta@@ sies .
i &apos;m just trying to save the world .
what about chapter nine ?
- you &apos;ll have to re@@ fresh my memory .
- chapter nine !
justice !
in k-@@ drama , life is fair .
and if evil goes un@@ con@@ fron@@ ted by the end of a series , it will continue to affect other dra@@ mas , either directly or in@@ directly .
well , then , you had better con@@ front him .
hello , everyone .
my name is se@@ th , and i am the owner of the so@@ on-@@ to-@@ open restaurant , se@@ th &apos;s liber@@ tine .
i wanted to take a moment to thank you all for coming here to honor our friend , ga@@ -in .
i &apos;d just like to say a few words before we say good-bye forever .
ga@@ -in played an important part in all of our lives .
we &apos;ll never know what she was thinking in those last minutes .
the desp@@ air she must have felt ... to take her own life ...
let &apos;s choose to remember her at her best , though .
as i &apos;m sure ga@@ -in herself would have wished of us .
rest in peace , ga@@ -in .
and perhaps now ... we could hear from her fiancé ?
park joon , are you here ?
that son of a bitch .
dad ...
ga@@ -in ...
i &apos;ve been trying to remember my happi@@ est memories with each of you , but no matter how much i try , i seem to come up blan@@ k .
my only wish right now is ...
i know it sounds crazy ... but i wish i was able to stop time .
then i &apos;d go back in time to those happy moments and re@@ live them with you .
but it &apos;s all over and done with .
no second chances .
everything &apos;s gone .
all gone !
what the hell do you want ?
justice .
you know ,
i &apos;ve been trying to figure out when things started going wrong , and it seems to line up with the day you appeared in my kitchen .
nice try , park joon . don &apos;t change the subject .
what ?
why did you do it , joon ?
what are you talking about ?
i know .
i should have known this whole time . i was just blin@@ ded by my feelings for you .
so blin@@ ded by your feelings that you tried to burn down my restaurant .
no , no , no , you don &apos;t get to si@@ dest@@ ep the issue here , mister .
what issue , claire ?
that you &apos;re a murderer !
you &apos;re a murderer , park joon .
are you on drugs ?
the only drug that i &apos;m on is the truth .
that doesn &apos;t even make sense !
yeah ?
well , neither does killing your father ! or your fiancée !
and then you save my life so i won &apos;t be onto you , but i &apos;m onto you !
i didn &apos;t kill anyone !
then why weren &apos;t you at the memorial ?
because i broke it off with her !
because i didn &apos;t want to marry her .
and that &apos;s why she killed herself . because of me !
b.@@ s. !
and why would i kill my father ?
i love my father .
so you wouldn &apos;t have to take over the company .
oh , you mean the company that i &apos;ve taken over ?
as op@@ posed to the restaurant that i &apos;ve lost ?
well , then why would you save me ?
you ruined it !
this whole place is screwed because you saved me . you idiot !
you big , stupid idiot .
oh , i &apos;m an idiot ?
i &apos;m a big , stupid idiot ?
- yeah !
- yeah ?
then what are you ?
i &apos;m a ... bigger , stupi@@ der idiot !
so ...
we &apos;re all set for the re@@ opening , right ?
of course .
se@@ o-@@ ye@@ on .
let &apos;s give it our all . i really want this to work .
for us .
can i take you home ?
that &apos;s okay .
i &apos;ve got a few things on my mind and don &apos;t mind walking .
but thank you again for everything .
i &apos;ll see you .
do you believe me now ?
i thought i had finally figured it all out .
figured out what ?
chapter nine .
you are a strange woman .
you should dress up more often .
i feel like such a fraud .
she knew why i didn &apos;t want to marry her .
because she &apos;s the bitch ?
uh ... no .
because ...
joon , don &apos;t .
you can &apos;t . and you don &apos;t . you don &apos;t even know me .
exactly . you &apos;re a mystery .
every woman i &apos;ve ever met , i know what she &apos;s thinking ,
i know what she wants to hear , but with you ... you &apos;re different .
it &apos;s like you &apos;re an alien or something .
you need to shut up , joon .
even the way you say my name .
even these last few days when i hated you .
and i hated you more than i &apos;ve ever hated any@@ thing@@ --
joon , stop .
even when you accused me of killing my own father .
and i don &apos;t think that would have been possible if i-- please .
don &apos;t .
look at me . no .
why ?
joon ...
do you not feel the same way ?
it isn &apos;t that .
then why ?
give me one reason why .
because if you didn &apos;t kill your father and ga@@ -in , someone else did .
and justice must be served .
what &apos;s that ?
this is complicated .
and if i saw what you &apos;re about to see , i &apos;d probably lose my min@@ d--
i ...
you &apos;ve been through a lot , and i don &apos;t know what else to do . rule number four .
and , and , and ... this is the most important of them all .
these characters cannot know they &apos;re in a drama . yea@@ p !
i know .
who are you talking to ?
yeah , i know it &apos;s risky ... and the world could end , or our faces could spon@@ tane@@ ously imp@@ lo@@ de , or@@ --
park joon !
yeah ?
i really hope this works .
you &apos;re ... park joon .

you didn &apos;t want shar@@ bat to go .
that &apos;s on record . now you &apos;re involved with ak@@ mal &apos;s shooting ?
you could be facing an article 15 .
it was self-@@ defense .
you want me to wait for backup to get there ?
ak@@ mal could have killed us all . you do realize that , right ?
you have nine days left , major .
you want your daughter to be mother@@ less because ...
don &apos;t ever , ever say that .
i &apos;m just pointing out the fact ... this is over .
this is the army , drew . this is not a democracy .
so here &apos;s how it &apos;s gonna happen , all right ?
we do not interfe@@ re with local medical decisions .
that comes straight from the penta@@ gon .

my patr@@ on won &apos;t let me work without a doctor &apos;s note .
i break horses .
my gra@@ mps did that .

they hate being told what to do . i like this girl .
she &apos;s smart .

_removed_
he beat her when she was pregnant ?
and that &apos;s not against the law .
ak@@ mal is the law .

damn .
the u@@ ter@@ ine la@@ c is exten@@ ded .
my baby ?
how &apos;s my baby ? everyone is fine .
you have a visitor .
you didn &apos;t go ? without you , never .
the u@@ ter@@ ine la@@ c is rap@@ i@@ dly expan@@ ding .
how &apos;s he doing ?
removed the injured bo@@ wel , but he &apos;s oo@@ zing everywhere .
&apos;cause he has no pla@@ te@@ lets . he needs them to c@@ lot .
- these should help . - te@@ mp &apos;s up to 10@@ 4 .
he went from freezing to burning up .
his white blood cell count is down , too .
you thinking what i &apos;m thinking ? trau@@ matic bone mar@@ row failure .
without working bone mar@@ row , he can &apos;t make new blood cells , which means he can &apos;t c@@ lot or fight infection .
he needs a tran@@ sp@@ lant . go test the parents for a match .
won &apos;t help , he &apos;s adopted .
well , then , try and track down his birth mother .
that &apos;s his best shot .
we can start him on anti@@ bio@@ tics and slow the infection , but without a tran@@ sp@@ lant .
_removed_
now , you sure you don &apos;t want us to put you under ?
you could wake up , and your son would be right here .
no , not with ak@@ mal around . i have to be awake to protect my son .
i would do the same thing .
you have kids , doctor ?
i do .
i have a daughter named ri@@ ley in texas .
she &apos;s gonna be 13 in two weeks .
- i married ak@@ mal at 13 . - yeah ?
ri@@ ley &apos;s gonna have a slu@@ mber party for her birthday .
it &apos;s gonna be no boys allowed .
drew :
your daughter &apos;s lucky to have such a strong role model .
the army &apos;s tough on women , especially mo@@ ms .
yeah , well , if you don &apos;t push for change , it never happens . - you got that right .

he &apos;s gonna need a tran@@ sp@@ lant .
we need to find his birth mother .
francis ? she was a drug addi@@ ct .
it was a closed ado@@ ption .
we never met .
test me , maybe i &apos;m a match .

shannon , you cannot bring emotion into this job . it clouds your judgment , and it can hurt your patient .

scar@@ ring from old frac@@ tures .
_removed_
_removed_
okay , his heart rate keeps dropping .
let &apos;s give him 0@@ .@@ 5 of at@@ ro@@ pine .
_removed_
we might need to p@@ ace him ex@@ ter@@ nally .
i talked to the chief of internal medicine at north@@ west , and she said that this is a &quot; be@@ ta blo@@ cker over@@ dose , &quot;
and he needs glu@@ ca@@ gon right now .
okay , that &apos;s an interesting theory , except he &apos;s not on be@@ ta blo@@ ckers .
then what &apos;s wrong with him ?
i don &apos;t have an answer . well , you better find one because if you don &apos;t ,
i &apos;m gonna sue you and this lousy excuse for a hospital for mal@@ practice .
you know , maybe if you spent a little less time on that phone of yours and more time with him , he wouldn &apos;t be here .
do as i say , not as i do , right ?
smar@@ t-@@ ass is a waste of my time .
all right , we &apos;ve obviously missed something , so let &apos;s run his la@@ bs again .
general ro@@ z@@ en@@ fe@@ ld called .
mark has told him both patients are in reco@@ very .
i talked to o@@ med . they can still make it to australia .
no , it &apos;s too late . ak@@ mal &apos;s gonna wake up any minute now .
actually , i mi@@ sca@@ l@@ cu@@ lated his weight during an@@ es@@ the@@ sia .
i thought he was 2@@ 20 . turns out he &apos;s 18@@ 0 , so the post-@@ op mor@@ phine might have been too much .
you d@@ osed him ?
on whose orders ? my patient , my call , right ?
that &apos;s a beautiful name . it means hope .
what did you have in mind ?
dr. ri@@ vera ?
it &apos;s dr. cu@@ m@@ min@@ gs . dr. cu@@ m@@ min@@ gs .
somebody put on his big-@@ boy pants .
try it some time , nurse four@@ ne@@ tte .
excuse me .
_removed_
thu@@ mb t@@ ack man .
i started remov@@ ing the tac@@ ks , then got pulled into a critical case , handed it off to a nurse .
and why did you not call for a trauma consu@@ lt ?
the wounds are all sha@@ llow .
i &apos;m sea@@ ling it with sur@@ gi@@ cal glu@@ e . on whose authority ? you are an inter@@ n .
did you even check a chest x-@@ ray for a p@@ neu@@ mo , maybe ?
dude didn &apos;t want sti@@ tches , doctor , so i suggested another way .
the e.@@ r. uses consul@@ tants for a reason , dr. ri@@ vera . 4@@ 1 pun@@ cture wounds is a trauma .
next time , call me instead of asking a nurse , or i will note it in your resi@@ dent file .
frankie &apos;s bleeding has stopped , but his b@@ p is still dropping .
he &apos;s in shock . we need that match .
any luck finding the birth mother ?
no . francis said he didn &apos;t know . he was fu@@ zzy on the whole thing .
couldn &apos;t remember her name or the ado@@ ption agency .
how do you forget where your kid came from ?
my parents could still tell you the address of their ado@@ ption lawyer .
well , exactly , so i spoke to to@@ ph &apos;s cousin , and the state has no ado@@ ption records for frankie .
he doesn &apos;t exist . that &apos;s impossible .
the cour@@ ts keep records on everything .
i &apos;ve seen my own ado@@ ption records .
you know what else is weird ?
he made me promise not to talk to his wife , didn &apos;t want to upset her .
yeah , well , she completely freaked out when we told her that you had found frankie , tore her sti@@ tches .
that &apos;s a pretty extreme reaction .
_removed_
_removed_
joan ?
it &apos;s dr. cal@@ la@@ han .
frankie needs your help .
_removed_
we need to find his birth family .
can you tell me why ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
_removed_
we all make mistakes .
usually , it &apos;s just we have to deal with them , but i don &apos;t care what you did back there .
i &apos;d trade my life for his .
then tell me about frankie , joan .
i was always meant to be a mother , but god wouldn &apos;t give me a baby .
and then one day , we were coming out of the movie theater , and there was frankie in a stro@@ ller .
and he smi@@ led at me .
and i just knew , in my heart , he was mine .
_removed_
_removed_
i mean , i-i thought it was just t@@ c being t@@ c , but he was right and he found the truth .

we were gonna save it , remember ? maybe frankie &apos;s birth parents saved his .
they &apos;re on a plane right now . we can &apos;t reach &apos; em .
we don &apos;t have to .
_removed_
i &apos;ll call .
good call , jordan . yeah , we always said it would come in handy .
i &apos;m sorry . ah .
i got to check on a patient .
excuse me .
miss martin@@ ez , i owe you an apology .
i had no right to talk to you like that . no .
you &apos;re right .
my dad and i would never talk .
my mom died when i was little .
it was just me and my dad .
he worked so hard so i could have everything i needed .
and you worked hard so he could stop .
made partner , bought a house in al@@ am@@ o hei@@ ghts , asked him to move in , but he wouldn &apos;t give up that ra@@ tty trailer at that ranch .
no matter what i do , he still cares more about his horses than me .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s true .
i &apos;m a lot like your dad .
you know , i work so i can avoid things , feel like i &apos;m in control .
that &apos;s why he won &apos;t leave the ranch , and why you are in the office until 1 : 00 a.m .

just worried about you , son .
i &apos;ve been visiting her .
every night i walk those streets home .
home from the dam .
home from the station .
i know now ... every single step of the way .
and i imagine that i &apos;m ... whisp@@ ering in her ear ...
i &apos;m here , it &apos;s alright .
what was she like ?
beautiful .
how was new york ?
it &apos;s the same .
so , what brings you back ?

okay , you win , take this
he was carrying a water@@ mel@@ on and didn &apos;t see it coming
what ?
what if you do find home and they &apos;re not even there ?
and you never stop and keep searching ?
and you don &apos;t know what happens over time , things change , and entire worlds change .
i don &apos;t have a choice .
stay .
i can &apos;t .
stay right there
weren &apos;t you supposed to look after him ?
where were you ?
don &apos;t you love him ?
john heard man@@ tos@@ h is out on the boats .
doing a lob@@ ster run .
he &apos;s due back tomorrow .
so he &apos;ll be flu@@ shed with cash , back on the hard stuff .
i &apos;m sorry you couldn &apos;t have your own kids .
what are you saying ?
we ...
we ... weren &apos;t blan@@ k pages , were we ?
like your own would have been .
you weren &apos;t just ado@@ p@@ ting us but our past as well .
- i feel like , we &apos;re killing you .
- i could have had kids .
what ?
we chose not to have kids .
we wanted the two of you .
that &apos;s what we wanted .
we wanted the two of you in our lives .
that &apos;s what we chose .
that &apos;s one of the reasons , i fell in love with your dad .
because we both felt , as if ... the world has enough people in it .
have a child , couldn &apos;t guarantee it will make anything better .
but to take a child that &apos;s suffering like you boys were .
give you a chance in the world .
that &apos;s something .
i bet you never imagined it being this hard .
it &apos;s not a matter of hard .
it &apos;s not a mat ...
there &apos;s only one path for me .
and , that &apos;s how i think .
that &apos;s how this happened because ...
when i was 12 ,
i had a vision .
some people would say , it was a break@@ down . but it ...
you know that , and he was like he wasn &apos;t a good man .
he was out of control when i was ...
i was standing at the back of the house .
i was looking out across this field .
and i just wanted the earth to swallow me up .
and i ...
i felt an electric current , it was like a shock , like a jo@@ lt through my whole body .
and then i saw ...
a brown skin@@ ned child across that field .
and he was standing beside me .
and it was right there and i could feel it so stron@@ gly .
and for the first time in my life i felt something good ...
i felt good .
and i knew it was gui@@ ding me .
and i knew that i was going to be fine .
it was , as if , that moment i could see my future , right there !
because i always thought that i could keep this family together .
and now ...
now i don &apos;t know .
where ...
- mum ...
- what &apos;s happening ? i don &apos;t understand .
you don &apos;t talk to me any more .
i need you , sa@@ ro@@ o .
man@@ tos@@ h !
sorry for what i said at dinner .
gan@@ e@@ sh tal@@ ai ...
gan@@ e@@ sh tal@@ ai .
gan@@ est@@ lay !
mum
i found home !
what ?
please wait for me .
i &apos;m here .
so this is where you &apos;ve been .
i don &apos;t want you to feel , i was un@@ grateful .
there wasn &apos;t a day , i didn &apos;t want to tell you .
sa@@ ro@@ o .
i really hope she &apos;s there .
she needs to see how beautiful you are !
hi , i used to live here .

i understand you boys .
you don &apos;t need to understand , you need to think .

with the two of us ?
if this was all about the two of us ,
i would &apos;ve proposed to you 2 weeks ago on that bridge in ho@@ lli@@ gen .

why did they order you back ?
because of &apos; 5@@ 6 .
i threw the á@@ v@@ ó officers out off the embassy on october 30 .

- it &apos;s worth shit without the code book .
damn !
what does a code book suppose to look like ?
small , big , thin , thick ?
i don &apos;t know ! i don &apos;t know .
it depends on how complicated the codes are .
what do you need the code book for ?
if you steal it , the state department will change the codes by tomorrow .
the code book can save lives and ex@@ pose the guilty .
and how do you plan to take it ?
stuff it into your under@@ pants and walk out the door ?
this is radio free europe . are you there , á@@ bel ?
yes . this is á@@ bel .
success ?
we &apos;re checking the safe now .
we &apos;re in the studio . ready to go on air .
we need one more minute .
do you want to read the codes out on the free europe ?
live on air .
those tra@@ itors in m@@ uni@@ ch are in on this too , huh ?
i can &apos;t believe it .
in a few minutes , comrade ambassador , the whole free world ... will know the codes of the hun@@ ga@@ rian state department .
all your dirty secrets will be exposed .
what does the code book look like ?
no idea .
this safe belongs to home affairs , i work for the state department .
if it &apos;s not in the safe , then ver@@ mes has it .
the ambassador &apos;s life in exchange for the code book !
i &apos;ve got bad news for you .
ver@@ mes has burnt the code book .
what did he say ?
ver@@ mes burnt the code book .
- ls there only one code book ?
- yes .
you &apos;re left with no other option .
you have to give yourselves up .
now what ?
we stay .
and if we have to die , the ambassador dies first .
have you got the code book ?
no .
i repeat : we don &apos;t have the code book .
in that case , i have to ab@@ ort the broadcast .
give us one more minute .

i don &apos;t have the permission to make any de@@ clar@@ ation .

two bandits are holding a gun to my head .
what happened at the embassy in 195@@ 6 ?
tell us what you wanted to say earlier .
what did im@@ re na@@ gy ask you to do ?
it wasn &apos;t im@@ re na@@ gy , it was the state department .
what did the state department ask you to do ?
to dis@@ miss the home affairs staff from the embassy .
the á@@ v@@ ó officers .
i was ordered to get rid of intelligence oper@@ a@@ tives .
- it &apos;s kor@@ ok@@ na@@ i .
- kor@@ ok@@ na@@ i ?
and ? did you throw them out ?
how ? what station is it ?
i sent them home , it &apos;s not a secret .
radio free europe .
when did this happen ?
on october 30 .
did you take the side of the revolution ?
i &apos;m a diplo@@ mat , i don &apos;t take sides .
i follow orders , that &apos;s all .
for r@@ á@@ kos@@ i and im@@ re na@@ gy equ@@ ally ?
i swore on the hun@@ ga@@ rian flag .
what happens at the top is not my business .
i &apos;m a professional . i do my job .
do you consider the revolution to be a professional matter ?
why &apos;s that important ? who cares ?
do you wei@@ gh orders up before you carry them out ?
yes , i do , like all normal people .
did you agree with throwing the á@@ v@@ ó out ?
i &apos;ll repeat
mi@@ h@@ á@@ ly ?
i followed an order .
did you agree or not ?
it &apos;s not easy to speak honestly with a gun to my head .
it &apos;s just as hard without a gun .
you don &apos;t want hone@@ sty from me , you want a confession .
relax ...
we &apos;re just talking .
thank you .
i don &apos;t understand what we &apos;re talking about .
- what ? live on air ?
- yes .
god@@ dammit !
we &apos;re just two hun@@ ga@@ ri@@ ans , away from home from the two sides of the t@@ ren@@ ches finally agre@@ eing on something .
we both hate the á@@ v@@ ó .
everybody hated the á@@ v@@ ó , didn &apos;t they ?
especially the diplo@@ ma@@ ts . that &apos;s no secret .
they &apos;re home affairs , we &apos;re the state department .
what are they doing in an embassy anyway ?
they don &apos;t speak langu@@ ages , they don &apos;t manage matters .
all they do is spy on our staff .
sno@@ ops , that &apos;s what they are .
when i got the call on october 30 that the new order was to dis@@ miss the á@@ v@@ ó what was i supposed to say ?
i was happy .
i never thought that communi@@ sm could end .
im@@ re na@@ gy was the greatest communist , wasn &apos;t he ?
he was a friend of ger@@ ő and r@@ á@@ kos@@ i . what was i supposed to think ?
haven &apos;t you heard about the revolution ?
the revolution happened differently for us .
we were far way .
we heard that the crow@@ ds were out on the streets , chasing the á@@ v@@ ó away .
and what did you think would happen ?
they &apos;d get rid of the á@@ v@@ ó and communi@@ sm would remain .
a communi@@ sm without the á@@ v@@ ó .
what else should i have thought ?
on october 30 , the orders came from the same people ... as before and since .
then why do they want to fire you ?
good question .
you followed their orders and now they &apos;re getting rid of you ?
after a shame@@ less , 18@@ -@@ month procedure , they came up ... with this outra@@ geous and humili@@ ating ver@@ di@@ ct .
you &apos;ll have me feeling sorry for you .
and im@@ re na@@ gy ?
what about him ?
what do you think of his execution ?
i can &apos;t apologi@@ se for others .
but what &apos;s your take on it ?
you fought for the same reason after all , didn &apos;t you ?
not exactly .
you both wanted to get rid of the á@@ v@@ ó .
if you &apos;re outra@@ ged by getting un@@ fairly fired for this , aren &apos;t you a bit upset about im@@ re na@@ gy getting executed ?
just because i &apos;m pissed off by it .
it &apos;s not the same .
what &apos;s not the same ?
im@@ re na@@ gy gave the order , i just carried it out .
you &apos;re just as responsible as the one who gave the order , don &apos;t you think ?
on that basis , a whole country could be called to account .
would you have executed im@@ re na@@ gy ?
let me say it again : i did not give the order .
- but you &apos;d carry it out .
- would you have carried it out ?
would you have executed him if you &apos;d been ordered ?
this conversation is over .
would you have killed im@@ re na@@ gy ?
- switch the radio off .
- say yes or no .
did he deserve to die ? did he deserve the rope ?
- would you have tied it around his neck ?
- kick the sto@@ ol from under his feet ?
watch him fighting for his life ?
- if you &apos;d been given the order ...
- would you have killed im@@ re na@@ gy ?
it was a mistake to kill im@@ re na@@ gy .
say it again .
it was a mistake to kill im@@ re na@@ gy .
a bloody big mistake .
i stru@@ gg@@ led ,
i plea@@ ded , at headquarters , with the minister , with k@@ á@@ d@@ á@@ r .
i told him it would be a huge mistake to execute im@@ re na@@ gy .
&quot; he &apos;s just a tired old man , wouldn &apos;t hurt a fly . &quot;
&quot; people will forget him quickly . &quot;
k@@ á@@ d@@ á@@ r said :
&quot; we don &apos;t understand you , comrade kor@@ ok@@ na@@ i . &quot;
&quot; im@@ re na@@ gy is a rat , an enemy of the state . &quot;
&quot; he has to die , right away . &quot;
i said : &quot; comrade k@@ á@@ d@@ á@@ r ... what will we achieve by execu@@ ting him ? &quot;
&quot; we &apos;d only make the counter@@ -@@ revolu@@ tion@@ aries stronger . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;d shake the im@@ mi@@ gran@@ ts up . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;d give them something one hundred times stronger than a tired old man . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;d give them a mar@@ ty@@ r . &quot;

what other one ?

it &apos;s a tradition going back generations . when i &apos;m king , that &apos;ll be the first thing to go .
not so long as i &apos;m around .
in that case , you &apos;re fired .
nice try , but only the king can do that .
well , he &apos;s the future king .
yeah , so you have to do what i tell you .
not yet , i don &apos;t .
and with an attitude like that , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re sh@@ aping up to be a pretty pathetic king , indeed .
not the way i see it .
&quot; i &apos;m gonna be a mighty king
&quot; so enemies beware &quot; well , i &apos;ve never seen a king of bea@@ sts
&quot; with quite so little hair
&quot; i &apos;m gonna be the main event
&quot; like no king was before

there were wil@@ de@@ bee@@ sts , and he tried to save me .
it was an accident . i didn &apos;t mean for it to happen .
of course .
of course you didn &apos;t .
no one ever means for these things to happen .
but the king is dead .
and if it weren &apos;t for you , he &apos;d still be alive .
what will your mother think ?

well , he &apos;s as good as dead out there anyway .
and if he comes back , we &apos;ll kill him .
yeah !
you hear that ? if you ever come back , we &apos;ll kill you !
mu@@ fa@@ sa &apos;s death is a terrible tragedy .
but to lose si@@ mb@@ a , who had barely begun to live ...
for me , it is a deep , personal loss .
so it is with a heavy heart that i assume the throne .
yet out of the ashes of this tragedy we shall rise to greet the daw@@ ning of a new era in which lion and hy@@ ena come together in a great and glorious future .
get out of here !

that &apos;s the stupi@@ dest thing i ever heard .
maybe he &apos;ll ...
hey , i &apos;ve got it . what if he &apos;s on our side ?

&quot; and if he falls in love tonight
&quot; it can be assumed
&quot; his care@@ free days
&quot; with us are history
&quot; in short , our pal
&quot; is doomed

it &apos;s something i learned out here .
sometimes bad things happen and there &apos;s nothing you can do about it .
so why worry ?
- because it &apos;s your responsibility .
- well , what about you ?
you left . i left to find help , and i found you .
don &apos;t you understand ? you &apos;re our only hope .
- sorry .
- what &apos;s happened to you ?
- you &apos;re not the si@@ mb@@ a i remember .

you know , you &apos;re starting to sound like my father .
good . at least one of us does .
you think you can just show up and tell me how to live my life ?
you don &apos;t even know what i &apos;ve been through .
i would if you &apos;d just tell me .
- forget it !
she &apos;s wrong .
i can &apos;t go back .
what would it prove , anyway ? it won &apos;t change an@@ ý@@ thing .

and it &apos;s because of me .
it &apos;s my fault .

si@@ mb@@ a &apos;s the ri@@ ghtful king .
the choice is yours , scar .
either step down or fight .
oh , must this all end in violence ?
i &apos;d hate to be responsible for the death of a family member .
- wouldn &apos;t you agree , si@@ mb@@ a ?
- that &apos;s not gonna work , scar .
i &apos;ve put it behind me .
but what about your faithful subjects ?
have they put it behind them ?
si@@ mb@@ a , what is he talking about ?
so you haven &apos;t told them your little secret .
well , si@@ mb@@ a , now &apos;s your chance to tell them .
tell them who is responsible for mu@@ fa@@ sa &apos;s death .

it &apos;s not true .
tell me it &apos;s not true .
- it &apos;s true .
- you see ? he admi@@ ts it !

it was an accident .
if it weren &apos;t for you , mu@@ fa@@ sa would be alive .
it &apos;s your fault he &apos;s dead !
- do you deny it ?
- no .
- then you &apos;re guilty .
- no , i &apos;m not a murderer !
oh , si@@ mb@@ a , you &apos;re in trouble again , but this time daddy isn &apos;t here to save you , and now everyone knows why !
now , this looks familiar .
where have i seen this before ? let me think .
oh , yes .

this is just the way your father looked before he died .
and here &apos;s my little secret .
i killed mu@@ fa@@ sa .
