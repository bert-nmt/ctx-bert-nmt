babe , it &apos;s just we &apos;ve been on this road over an hour , and we haven &apos;t seen a single car .
molly , i know how to read a fri@@ ck@@ in &apos; map , okay ?
we passed a gas station a while back .
let &apos;s just go ask someone .
that was 40 minutes ago .
we &apos;re not turning around .
come on .
isn &apos;t this argument a little ar@@ cha@@ ic ?
men can ask directions these days .
no , we can &apos;t .
it &apos;s against our gene@@ tic code .
look , i know exactly where we are .
oh , yeah ? where ?
highway 99 , okay ?
it cuts right through .
highway 99 , huh ?
okay , so we &apos;re taking the scen@@ ic route .

holy
you &apos;ve got to help me .
please .
please ! all right , all right .
calm down , calm down .
tell us what happened .
i-i sw@@ er@@ ved , a-@@ and we crashed .
and when i came to , the car was wre@@ cked and my husband was missing .
i went looking for him , but that &apos;s when the man from the road , he ... he started chasing me .
did he look like he lost a fight with a lawn mo@@ wer ?
how did you know that ?
lucky guess .
ma &apos;am , what &apos;s your name ?
_removed_
_removed_
i think maybe you should come with us .
we &apos;ll take you back into town .
_removed_
he might have gone back to the car .
well , we should get you somewhere safe first .
and then dean and i &apos;ll come back here . we &apos;ll look for your husband .
no .
i &apos;m not leaving here without him .
would you just take me back to my car , please ?
of course .
come on .
it &apos;s right over there .
i don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;m sure this is where it was .
w@@ -we hit that tree right there .
this ... this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
dean , we got to get out of here .
gree@@ ley could show up at any second .
what are you gonna tell her .
the truth ?
she &apos;s gonna take off running in the other direction .
i know it sounds crazy , but i crashed into that tree .
i don &apos;t know who could &apos;ve taken it .
it was to@@ tal@@ ed .
please . you have to believe me .
molly , listen , we do believe you .
but that &apos;s why we want to get you out of here .
what about david ?
something must have happened .
i have to get to the cops .
cops ... that &apos;s a great idea .
we &apos;ll take you down to the station ourselves .
so just come with us .
it &apos;s the best way we can help you and your husband .
okay .
we &apos;re supposed to be in lake ta@@ ho@@ e .
you and david ?
it &apos;s our five-@@ year anniversary .
hell of an anniversary .
right before , we were having the du@@ m@@ best fight .
it was the only time we ever really argu@@ ed ... when we were stuck in the car .
yeah .
i know how that goes .
you know the last thing i said to him ?
i called him a jerk .
oh , god .
what if that &apos;s the last thing i said to him ?
_removed_
we &apos;re gonna figure out what happened to your husband .
i promise .
did you ?
no .
i was afraid you &apos;d say that .
this song .
what ?
it was playing when we crashed .
she &apos;s mine .
she &apos;s mine .
she &apos;s mine .
what is that ?
hold on .
what are you doing ?
what the ...
what the hell just happened ? don &apos;t worry , molly .
everything &apos;s gonna be all right .
_removed_
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s gonna leave .
this can &apos;t be happening .
well ...
trust me , it &apos;s happening .
well ...
okay .
thanks for helping , but i think i got it covered from here .
wait .
molly , molly , wait a minute .
just leave me alone .
no , no , no , please ! you have to listen ...
just stay away .
it wasn &apos;t a coincidence that we found you , all right ?
what are you talking about ?
we weren &apos;t cru@@ ising for chicks when we ran into you , sister .
we were already out here .
hunting .
hunting for what ?
ghosts .
d ... d ... don &apos;t ...
sugar coat it for her .
you &apos;re nuts .
really ?
about as nuts as a vani@@ shing guy with his guts spi@@ lling out .
you know what you saw .
we think his name is jon@@ ah gree@@ ley .
he was a local farmer that died 15 years ago on this highway .
just stop .
one night a year , on the anniversary of his death , he haun@@ ts this road .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re here , molly .
to try and stop him .
now , i suppose this ghost made my car disappear , too .
cra@@ zi@@ er things have happened .
huh ?
you know what ?
i &apos;m all filled up on crazy .
i &apos;m gonna get the cops myself .
i don &apos;t mean to be harsh , but i don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna get too far .
what is that supposed to mean ?
means that plan &quot; a &quot; was trying to get you out of here .
obviously that didn &apos;t go over too well with , uh , farmer road kill .
molly , we &apos;re telling the truth .
gree@@ ley &apos;s not gonna let you leave this highway .
you &apos;re s ... you &apos;re serious about this , aren &apos;t you ?
deadly .
ever@@ year , gree@@ ley finds someone to punish for what happened to him .
tonight that person is you .
why me ?
i didn &apos;t do anything .
doesn &apos;t matter .
some spirits only see what they want .
so you &apos;re saying this gree@@ ley , he took my husband ?
oh , god .
molly , look , we &apos;re gonna help , all right ?
but first , you got to help us .
help you ?
how ?
this is it . this is where i saw him .
must have been his hunting cabin .
seemed like a real sweet guy .
no mar@@ kers or head@@ stones outside .
you &apos;re looking for gree@@ ley &apos;s grave ?
yeah .
why ?
so we can dig up the corpse and salt and burn it .
oh .
sure . naturally .
it &apos;s a way to get rid of a spirit .
and that &apos;ll save david ?
this is what &apos;ll help both of you , provided there &apos;s a corpse to be found .
so how do we find it ?
uh , not sure .
after gree@@ ley died , his wife claimed the body .
and that was the last anyone saw of her .
so good guess she brought him back here .
but they have a thousand ac@@ res .
he could be buried anywhere on &apos; em .
is is really what you guys do .
you &apos;re like ghost bu@@ sters .
yeah .
minus the ju@@ mp@@ suits .
this is a fascinating conversation and all .
but this highway is only haun@@ ted once a year , and we got till sun up to wrap this thing up .
what do you say we move it along , okay ?
great .
what are we looking for ?
gree@@ ley &apos;s house .
maybe he &apos;s buried there .
look for roads or paths or something .
stay close .
yeah .
okay .
_removed_
molly , help me .
_removed_
_removed_
_removed_
hey !
are you all right ?
what has that son of a bitch done with my husband ?
just take it easy , all right ?
you &apos;re gonna see david again .
you will .
hey .
follow the creepy brick road .
go ahead .
that thing shoot@@ s rock salt ?
yep .
and plain salt keeps away spirits ?
simple reme@@ dies are always the best .
in most cul@@ tures , salt is a symbol of pu@@ rity , so it repe@@ ls imp@@ ure and un@@ natural things .
same reason you throw it over your shoulder .
you know , just once i &apos;d like to round the corner and see a nice house .
any head@@ stones outside ?
yeah , right .
is it ever that easy ?
i guess not .
you two check upstairs .
see if you can find any notes or records telling us where he &apos;s buried .
i &apos;ll just check down here .
great .
look at this .
it &apos;s gree@@ ley and his wife .
it &apos;s a love letter he wrote her .
my god , it &apos;s beautiful .
i don &apos;t understand how a guy like this can turn into that monster .
spirits like gree@@ ley are , uh ...
like wounded animals .
lost .
in so much pain , that they la@@ sh out .
why ?
why are they here ?
well , there &apos;s some part of them that ...
that &apos;s keeping them here .
like their remains or , um ...
un@@ finished business .
yeah .
it could be revenge .
could be love .
or hate .
whatever it is , they just hold on too tight .
can &apos;t let go .
so they &apos;re trapped .
caught in the same lo@@ ops .
re@@ playing the same tra@@ ge@@ dies over and over .
you sound almost sorry for them .
well , they weren &apos;t evil people , you know ?
a lot of them were good .
just ...
something happened to them .
something they couldn &apos;t control .
sammy &apos;s always getting a little j. love he@@ wi@@ tt when it comes to things like this .
me , i don &apos;t like &apos; em .
and i sure as hell ain &apos;t making apologies for &apos; em .
there &apos;s nothing downstairs .
uh , just about every piece of mail or receipt they ever had .
looked through a couple , but nothing about a grave so far .
what ?
there &apos;s something behind here .
here .
it &apos;s locked from the inside .
smells like old lady in here .
and that would explain why .
well , now we know why nobody ever saw her again .
she didn &apos;t want to live without him .
dean , give me a hand .
really ?
what are you gonna do ?
we can &apos;t leave her like this .
why not ?
she deserves to be put to rest , dean .
so ...
so , if you manage to put gree@@ ley to rest , too ...
what happens to them ?
lady , that answer is way beyond our pay grade .
you hunt these things , but you don &apos;t know what happens to them ?
well , they never come back .
that &apos;s all that matters .
after they let go of whatever &apos;s keeping them here , they ...
they just go .
i hope someplace better , but we don &apos;t know .
no one does .
what happens when you burn their bones ?
well , my dad used to say that was like death for ghosts , you know ?
but ...
the truth is , we still don &apos;t know .
not for sure .
guess that &apos;s why we all hold on to life so hard .
even the dead .
we &apos;re all just scared of the unknown .
the only thing i &apos;m scared of is losing david .
i have to see him again .
i have to .
i think we should tell her about her husband . we can &apos;t .
dean , it &apos;s cruel , letting her pine for him like this .
i don &apos;t like keeping her in the dark .
it &apos;s for her own good .
i know you feel guilty , but let &apos;s just stick to the plan .
let &apos;s get her out of here . then we &apos;ll tell her .
tell me what ?
what aren &apos;t you telling me ?
it &apos;s about david . you know what happened to him .
molly sam , don &apos;t .
don &apos;t what ?
don &apos;t tell me because i &apos;ll mess up your hunt ?
you don &apos;t care about me or my husband .
that &apos;s not true .
really ?
then whatever it is , tell me , please .
he &apos;s coming .
stay with her ...
he &apos;s got molly !
this guy is per@@ si@@ stent .
we got to find molly .
we got to find gree@@ ley &apos;s bones .
and , uh , no pressure or anything , but we got less than two hours before sun@@ rise .
hey .
what do you got ?
&quot; february 6 , 199@@ 2 . &quot;
that was like two weeks before the accident , wasn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
it looks like the hunting cabin , but ...
i swear there &apos;s a tree there right where they &apos;re standing .
should have thought of it .
what ?
it &apos;s an old country custo@@ m , dean .
plan@@ ting a tree as a grave mar@@ ker .
you &apos;re like a walking en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia of weir@@ dness .
yeah . i know .
where &apos;s david ?
what did you do to him ?
you shouldn &apos;t worry about him anymore .
oh , my god .
you should worry about yourself .
i didn &apos;t do anything to you .
oh ?
i know ... i know about your wife .
hurting me won &apos;t bring her back .
my wife is gone .
all i got left &apos;@@ shu@@ r@@ ting you .
p-@@ please .
just let me go .
go ?
you &apos;re not gonna leave .
you &apos;re never gonna leave .
go get molly .
oh , thank god .
call me dean .
this guy &apos;s really pi@@ ssing me off .
oh , baby , it &apos;s been a long night .
all right .
let &apos;s get you out of here .
i &apos;m not going anywhere until you tell me what happened to my husband .
_removed_
all this time i &apos;ve been looking for him , and you knew that ...
you knew that gree@@ ley killed him , didn &apos;t you ?
he &apos;s dead .
no , molly .
david &apos;s alive .
what ?
you &apos;re sure ?
i &apos;m sure .
we &apos;ll take you to him .
come on .
he &apos;s in that house right there .
i don &apos;t understand .
you will .
that &apos;s not ...
it can &apos;t be .
what &apos;s happening ?
who is that ?
that &apos;s david &apos;s wife .
i &apos;m sorry , molly .
15 years ago , you and your husband it jon@@ ah gree@@ ley with your car .
what are you saying ?
we &apos;re saying there isn &apos;t just one spirit haun@@ ting highway 4@@ 1 .
there are two .
jon@@ ah gree@@ ley and you .
for the past 15 years , one night a year you &apos;ve been appea@@ ring on that highway .
no . that &apos;s not possible .
february 2@@ 2nd ... 199@@ 2 .
yes .
molly , it &apos;s 200@@ 7 .
oh , god .
all right . tell me about highway 4@@ 1 .
12 acci@@ dents over 15 years .
five of them fatal , all of them happening on the same night .
so what are we looking at ... inter@@ state dead zone ?
phan@@ tom hi@@ tch@@ hi@@ ker ?
what ? not quite .
year after year , witnesses said the same thing made &apos; em crash
a woman appea@@ ring in the middle of the road being chased by a man covered in blood .
two spo@@ ok@@ s ?
now , where is molly buried ?
she ... she wasn &apos;t buried anywhere .
she was cre@@ mated .
so much for burning her bones .
yeah , but then what &apos;s keeping her here ?
some spirits only see what they want .
_removed_

stop !

dean , i don &apos;t think she knows she &apos;s dead .
please !
open up !
please !
okay . all right , all right .
just calm down .
tell us what happened .
what are you gonna tell her ?
the truth .
she &apos;s gonna take off running in the other direction .
some spirits hold on too tight .
can &apos;t let go .
and gree@@ ley ?
each year he puni@@ shes somebody for his death ... chasing them .
tor@@ turing them .
and each year , that somebody is you .
but i don &apos;t remember any of it .
because you couldn &apos;t see the truth , molly .
so that &apos;s why he won &apos;t let me off the highway .
because ...
i killed him .
i killed us both .
why didn &apos;t you tell me when you first saw me ?
why wait until now ?
you wouldn &apos;t have believed us .
and you needed me for bait .
well , we needed you .
_removed_
molly , we brought you here so you could move on .
i have to tell him .
that you love him ?
that you &apos;re sorry ?
molly , he already knows that .
look , if you want to go in there , we &apos;re not gonna stop you .
yeah , but you are gonna freak him right out .
for life .
david &apos;s already said his good b@@ yes , molly .
now it &apos;s your turn .
this is your un@@ finished business .
what am i supposed to do ?
just ...
let go .
of david . of everything .
you do that ...
we think you &apos;ll move on .
but you don &apos;t know where .
no .
molly , you don &apos;t belong here .
haven &apos;t you suffered long enough ?
it &apos;s time .
it &apos;s time to go .
i guess she wasn &apos;t so bad ...
for a ghost .
you think she &apos;s really going to a better place ?
i hope so .
i guess we &apos;ll never know .
not until we take the plun@@ ge ourselves , huh ?
doesn &apos;t really matter , dean .
hope &apos;s kind of the whole point .

oh , jeez , you picked up a bad one somewhere , huh ?

i know it was embarrassing for you , but ... anyway , if you ever wanted to tal@@ k@@ -- this is who dad is .
my friends don &apos;t judge me .
and fuck them if they do , i &apos;ll cut them off .
that voice , that voice .
it &apos;s done , tony , over . my advice now is to put it behind you .
if this is all there is , these 23 tickets , they don &apos;t have &quot; bu@@ b@@ kes &quot; and they know it .
i know it &apos;s a small thing , but that &apos;s the fucking point .
one more minute , if i could &apos;ve just stood there saying , &quot; yes , ma , okay , ma , i hear you , ma &quot; , one more minute , i wouldn &apos;t be in this spot .

my mother , my fucking goddamn idiot of a mother .
you &apos;d think she was never married to johnny so@@ p@@ ran@@ o .
is there something else bothering you , anthony ?
that &apos;s not enough ?
fucking de@@ mented , old bat .
you &apos;re so angry with your mother and the air@@ line tickets .
i &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s not serious , but a year ago your mother coll@@ u@@ ded to have you killed , yet you never say &quot; boo &quot; about that , even when i try to eli@@ c@@ it .
if she tried to have you killed a year ago , believe me , in your childhood , she &apos;s in@@ fli@@ cted serious psychic injuries that are still there .
poor me .
and your father , the gangster , tough guy .
did he protect you kids from bor@@ der@@ line mother ?
what the hell was going on there ?
what is this ?
little sn@@ acks for thought for me to take home ?
i haven &apos;t pushed you enough to con@@ front these things .
somewhere along the line , i became frightened of you .
maybe i should &apos;ve seen that clea@@ rer in the beginning .
rage , anthony , is a big , loud , fla@@ ming , self distrac@@ tion from feelings that are even more frigh@@ tening .
what feelings might those be ?
sadness .
you go off on a rac@@ ist rant about indian food , your de@@ mented , old bat of a mother .
what else has happened ?
nothing .
after two years treating you , i &apos;ve learned things .
and i pick up sorrow coming from you .
i had a dream i fucked your brains out , right on that desk .
you loved it .
you threw that at me like a rock .
sadness , anthony , stay with that .

in fact , it was quite a big difference .
you have to understand , i was just craw@@ ling along , i had one day to live .
i was on my knees and i was hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ating .
and then , those enormous doors opened up .
lots of horses kept gal@@ lo@@ ping out and there wasn &apos;t death , there was ... driving those horses , it was the angels .
and i had this vision .
death didn &apos;t want me . death didn &apos;t really want me .
men are often haun@@ ted by things that happen to them in life , especially in war or other peri@@ ods of great inten@@ sity .
sometimes , you see these men walking the streets or driving in a car .
their lives seem to be normal , but they are not .
when i &apos;m driving my car i often hear the voices of my dead friends .
sometimes , my friend du@@ ane martin calls me and tells me that his feet are cold .
because of this , even on a warm sun@@ ny day , i keep my conver@@ ti@@ ble top up .
i was shot down over la@@ os in 196@@ 6 , in the early phase of the vietnam war .
i never wanted to go to war .
i only got into this because i had one burning desire , and that was to fly .
but that there were people down there who suffered and who died only became clear to me much later ... when i was their prisoner .
this is die@@ ter den@@ gler .
he came to america 40 years ago , and for the last 15 years he has lived on mount ta@@ mal@@ pa@@ is , north of san francisco .
yeah , this is a lot of fun .
you see , this really seems strange to most people , but to me it &apos;s very important .
it de@@ notes freedom to be able to open or close a door .
when i was a prisoner , i couldn &apos;t open the door , and later on when i was dying those big doors in the sky would open up .
and so ... most people don &apos;t realize how important it is , and the privile@@ ge that we have to be able to open or close a door .
so ... anyway , that &apos;s a habit i got into and ... so be it !
well , this is the inside of my home .
but you see , when you come into my house right away there are pictures of open doors .
that &apos;s been always very important to me and ... it gives me a sense of freedom .
walk into my house , when i built this house 15 years ago
i focused on having this open feeling .
this was very important to me that i am on top of the mountain ,
i needed to find some kind of can@@ yon .
well , looking out here you see a p-@@ 5@@ 1 must ...
flying was always very important to me as a child
got little mo@@ tors in there , don &apos;t know if they still work .
i can climb up there and see .
yes , they do .
anyway , again , just standing here you see that
i do have an open feeling in this house . there &apos;s a ... large sto@@ ve .
i really enjoy to cook . food is very , very , very important to me .
as you see , there &apos;s a lot of food .
the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator is always packed full with food .
the cup@@ board is full of food .
in fact , as i look in there it &apos;s half empty .
not only that , below the house
i have emergency pro@@ visions that i put in there years ago , that i &apos;m kind of ho@@ ar@@ ding down there .
well , i &apos;m really curious myself now to see if everything is still in good shape down here .
tear up this carpet here .
and those ... those five gal@@ lon con@@ tain@@ ers .
yeah , everything seems to be ... still in good shape down here .
there is a 1000 pounds of rice .
there is a 1,@@ 200 pounds of fl@@ our and whe@@ at .
there &apos;s 300 pounds of honey .
there &apos;s sugar down there .
i tell you , i &apos;ll probably never need ... any of this food , but i can sleep so much better knowing that it &apos;s down there .
well , while i was in prison ... all we did talk about was food .
we talked about deep free@@ z@@ ers , and ... re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , st@@ acking &apos; em up and
i decided i &apos;m coming back home and i &apos;m gonna build a restaurant .
a german type restaurant and i &apos;m gonna st@@ ack it up and never be hungry again .
this is my mother .
she arrived in america after i had gained about 30 or 40 pounds .
i was in san die@@ go , in a hospital .
she ... came on an air@@ plane with ...
she turned the meal down , in the air@@ planes , because she thought it cost her a lot of money .
and , she was truly star@@ ved .
this is my father .
i only know my father from pictures .
he was killed in the war .
i miss not having a father .
it was just then later on ... when i was in vietnam and my friend du@@ ane &apos;s head was ... cut off and the viet@@ con@@ gs were all around me , there was just shooting and yelling , and ... yeah , i was just running along down this trail .
and then i came to this river for@@ k and ...
here was my father , clear as a picture in the middle of the river standing and pointing with his arm , and just pointing and pointing ... for me , for the direction to go .
and i went behind the rocks and i worked my way up that ri@@ ver@@ bed .
i heard the viet@@ con@@ gs come by up the other side .
they went up the other side ,
and then later on , about five days later , i was rescu@@ ed going up this other side .
so ... that was truly a miracle .
below me , you see my home town , wild@@ berg .
i was born there .
my childhood years were ... spent right here .
down here you see the church and a few houses to the left , with my house .
it &apos;s not there anymore , the bo@@ mbers came and ... and wiped out this town .
the first air@@ plane ...
the first air@@ planes that i ever saw in my life , they came right over here .
they were fighters . they were ... they do@@ ve down onto this small town .
they mad sen@@ se@@ less attacks on this small village just like this .
in behind me ... up there .
that &apos;s kind of how it looked .
i had two brothers then and we were out on the top window , and we looked out .
and we watched all this , and i clearly remember one of the air@@ planes ... came di@@ ving at our house , and it was so unusual because the cock@@ pit was open .
the pilot had black go@@ gg@@ les that were sitting on his fore@@ head .
he was looking . he had actually turned around !
he was looking in the window .
and the machine guns were just firing , because the ... the fla@@ shes ...
i kept seeing them coming out .
and the left wing tip just missed the house by two or three feet . i seen it rip by !
_removed_
it was like an almighty being ...
that came out . it &apos;s just something else that &apos;s very difficult to describe .
but i knew from that moment on that i wanted to be a pilot .
i wanted to be a fli@@ er .
from that moment on little die@@ ter needed to fly .
i have a few me@@ d@@ als that i received .
that &apos;s an american fighter ace medal .
_removed_
distin@@ gui@@ shed flying cross , and the navy cross .
up here in the corner , this sword is called the sword of lo@@ yo@@ la .
it was blessed by the pope , it &apos;s brought over here by a bishop .

what does it mean for you to be a war hero ?
oh , i &apos;m not a hero .
only people who are dead who are heroes .
and that &apos;s not a thing i want to be , and i don &apos;t think of myself as a hero .
no , only dead people are heroes .
if i start over here ...
this picture was sent to me recently by a friend .
this is the last shot of my air@@ plane after i took ... when i took off for vietnam .
and this is how the air@@ plane looked two hours later .
and this is die@@ ter den@@ gler , six months later , after his rescue .
he was down to 8@@ 5 pounds .
i knew hun@@ ger as a child .
i grew up in post-@@ war germany .
we lived in great po@@ ver@@ ty and i remember as children going to bomb@@ ed out buildings , where we tore off wall@@ paper .
my mother would cook the wall@@ paper and we would eat it ... because there were nu@@ tri@@ ents in the glu@@ e .
as a child , die@@ ter saw things around him that just made no earth@@ ly sense at all .
germany had been trans@@ formed into a drea@@ m@@ sc@@ ape of the sur@@ real .
and then , things got better .
die@@ ter reme@@ mbers the first sau@@ sage in a display window .
it was the first one in years , and he stopped and sta@@ red at it .
everyone else stopped too , but nobody could afford to buy it .
in post-@@ war germany , there was no a@@ vi@@ ation .
and therefore , it rema@@ ined die@@ ter &apos;s dream to become a pilot .
this is a very , very , very old ... rare clock .
from age 14 , den@@ gler app@@ ren@@ ti@@ ced as a tool and d@@ ye maker .
he learned how to build church clo@@ cks .
not only did i learn to be a ... church clock buil@@ der ,
i learned to be a black@@ smith .
god ! what a tough app@@ ren@@ ti@@ ce@@ ship i had !
how many hours did i stand right here ?
how many times did i have that hammer on my side ?
i had this boss who was ... an old man .
he was a black@@ smith , he had hands like that .
many times ... he would come up and hit me in the face .
i would be just ... i would be passing out .
we worked from seven in the morning till late at night .
including week@@ ends . we made 50 cents a month .
it was truly horrible , but we stuck with it .
and then , later on in vietnam ...
that &apos;s the first time i recognized it .
what it meant really to me and without this tough , tough , tough man that beat us many , many times ;
i could have never made it .
he finished his app@@ ren@@ ti@@ ce@@ ship at age 18 .
thirty minutes after his final exam die@@ ter was already en route to america , because his dream of being a pilot had never died .
this photo was taken the moment he left .
i left from right down here for america .
i had 30 cents in my pocket ...
i was two hours out of town , i was hungry .
i had two weeks to wait for my ship to leave and i hi@@ tch@@ hi@@ ked ... via ham@@ burg , to bre@@ mer@@ haven where the boat left .
i was climb@@ ing up the ladder , i got sea@@ sick right away .
in the back of the ship they were playing a german national song :
i stepped on the ship and got sea@@ sick .
i was viol@@ ently sick for 2 1 / 2 weeks .
but , i managed to go up in the kitchen or living room ...
not the living room , but where people were eating , and there i got sandwi@@ ches and i got or@@ an@@ ges .
and i ho@@ ar@@ ded it all in my room .
and then , early in the morning there was an announcement that the statue of liberty was going to come in sight .
i went in my room . i took this large shirt from my grandfather .
_removed_
and i thought , we &apos;re just going to arrive , i &apos;ll walk off the ship .
but we had to go through customs . well , i never heard of customs .
i was this little 18 year old boy , i never was out of my hometown .
one time for one day we went to a castle somewhere .
we were extremely poor .
so , anyway i went through customs .
a lot of people were lined up . this customs agent came over .
the first thing , he grabbed my shirt .
pulled my shirt up and all the sandwi@@ ches and all those or@@ an@@ ges fell on the floor .
i got be@@ et red because when i left my hometown people were laughing , they said :
&quot; he &apos;s going to america . money &apos;s gonna ... he thinks money grows on the trees ! &quot;
they thought i &apos;m gonna end up in jail , and now i knew ... hey were right , i &apos;m gonna end up in jail .
i didn &apos;t speak any english , i knew a few words .
ti@@ mmy square ... times square .
the highest house , two-@@ story houses that i saw in germany .
here , i &apos;m in new york . manhattan .
walking around it was just a whole new world for me .
but again , of course i was extremely hungry .
so , i lived in the streets for about ten days and i met a couple people .
and then finally , i joined the air force .
because i really left germany to become a pilot .
and i couldn &apos;t do it in germany , germany didn &apos;t have an air force .
they didn &apos;t have an air@@ line , they had no scho@@ o@@ ling whatsoever .
we had to work to help our parents just to survive and to live .
and so , i went to the recru@@ i@@ ter in new jersey and he said :
&quot; of course ! if you join the air force you &apos;re going to be a pilot . &quot;
i signed up , two hours later i was in san antonio , texas . they cut my hair off .
but instead of becoming a pilot they put me in the kitchen .
there were 5@@ 000 recru@@ its there .
7@@ 000 recru@@ its ! i pe@@ eled potatoes for 2 1 / 2 years .
and then finally , i was put in the motor pool .
i changed ti@@ res but i never got near an air@@ plane .
i went to night school . i became a citizen .
and then , i left for california because i knew by then what i had to do .
i had to go to college , get a college degree to join the navy .
and that &apos;s what i did . i bought a car , an old v@@ w bus .
there was a big hole in the side .
i parked in the parking lot . i had my sur@@ f@@ board in there , my sk@@ is in there .
that &apos;s where i lived for 2 1 / 2 years .
worked at night , went to cho@@ ol .
and after that i joined the navy .
and then , i was based in al@@ ame@@ da .
and from there we left on the aircraft carri@@ er for vietnam .
but from the air , vietnam didn &apos;t seem real at all .
for den@@ gler it was like a grid on a map .
he had suddenly found himself not only a pilot , but a soldier caught up in a real war .
but even though it was all very real , everything down there seemed to be so alien and so ab@@ str@@ act .
it all looked strange , like a distant , bar@@ ba@@ ric dream .
also , i ...
i flew the sky@@ rai@@ der ... over vietnam , i had just left the carri@@ er .
i had flo@@ wn 2 1 / 2 hours through heavy fla@@ k .
i was coming near my target .
and i clearly remember my target was disappea@@ ring right at the wing root , where the wing mee@@ ts the body .
and i rolled the air@@ plane on its back
and then , of course i would see the target above me and i was coming straight down and just when i was in@@ ver@@ ted there was this loud explosion off the right side , half my wing was gone .
and i remember the bri@@ ght@@ ness of it was just like a lightning stri@@ king .
the air@@ plane then tu@@ mbled through the air .
i reached down and i dropped my tanks , and i thought i &apos;ll belly the air@@ plane down in this valley .
but then , more explosi@@ ons went off , off my right wing . boom ! boom !
the bri@@ ght@@ ness is really what i remember .
i decided , maybe i can ... fly the air@@ plane and gli@@ de it right over this ridge .
there was a ridge on the right hand side .
there was a lot of trees , as i said .
there was a ... an enormous tree in front of me and just before i hit it i kicked full right ru@@ dder .
the air@@ plane ya@@ wed to the right .
there was an impact on the left wing .
it sn@@ apped this ... this , this thick tree off and of course then the left wing went back .
then the entire tail : the ru@@ dder , h@@ ose , st@@ abi@@ li@@ zer ...
everything just tu@@ mbled by .
i clearly the can@@ op@@ y started crac@@ king , the lower left hand corner .
just like slow motion . it was cracked and it ripped off . then my helmet just jer@@ ked off my head .
and then the air@@ plane started to car@@ t@@ wheel .
then i must have passed out because maybe a minute later i came back .
i was laying 100 feet from the air@@ plane .
_removed_
you know , many times people ask me if i was afraid , if there was fear when i was shot down .
there really is no time .
i had to un@@ stra@@ p . i had to drop my fuel tanks .
i had to find ... i had to put the air@@ plane in a small clea@@ ring .
it was extremely difficult to fly this air@@ plane .
there was no time to have fear .
and then later on it &apos;s just like on an aircraft carri@@ er .
3 : 00 in the morning , you &apos;re flying through this mon@@ soon rain .
it &apos;s really not a rain , it &apos;s a water@@ fall that you &apos;re shooting through at 80 feet over the water ,
200 mp@@ h trying to find the aircraft carri@@ er .
you have only contact through your head@@ set with the oper@@ ator on the ship .
it &apos;s total darkness .
then , finally there &apos;s this enormous bang as you hit the back of the aircraft carri@@ er on your landing .
then , as you pull over to the side ...
as i turned my engine off ...
the engine would spin down .
spin down . then , my legs ...
that &apos;s the time when my legs start shaking . they would ...
_removed_
i would some time have to sit in cock@@ pit for five minutes before i could crawl out .
and ir@@ oni@@ cally ... later on , just before dying , there is no more fear .
it &apos;s like a dream .
it &apos;s just like floating along in a real thick medi@@ um .
i used to pin@@ ch myself , there was no more pain .
and i thought :
&quot; is this real ? is this un@@ real ? &quot;
this .
this is ... this is basically what death looks like to me .
two days after i was shot down , i was captured .
i did the un@@ forgi@@ vable , i crossed a small clea@@ ring .
i came out of the thick jungle ...
i came to a small trail . i looked to the left , i looked to the right .
there was no one there .
i went to run across .
i was at about ten yards out of it and someone ye@@ lled : i turned to the right .
there &apos;s a guy standing there with a pistol , another guy was standing there with a rifle .
my hands shot in the air . i ye@@ lled in german : &quot; ni@@ ch@@ t schi@@ e@@ ß@@ en ! ni@@ ch@@ t schi@@ e@@ ß@@ en ! &quot;
right away i was surrounded by six other guys .
they stri@@ pped of my clothes , i was searched .
they took everything away .
they ban@@ da@@ ged my left leg with ba@@ mbo@@ o because i hurt that in the crash .
and then we started to run .
we ran and ran . every so often i would collap@@ se .
they would massage my leg . they would give me ... some water .
and then later in the evening with a rifle underneath a clu@@ ster of trees so the air@@ planes couldn &apos;t see us .
normally ... they took four pe@@ gs in the ground
i would have to lay on the ground .
_removed_
in his dreams , den@@ gler would walk through an airport .
he was going to fly back home to the black forest .
but all the planes had been sma@@ shed to pieces .
yet , he knew that the pieces would start to move , and to rea@@ sse@@ mble themselves again into real planes .
as a broken coffee cup in the film &apos; play it backwards &apos; puts itself together and le@@ aps back up on the table .
i was sure that my flight would be on time .
but then , the pieces of the plane didn &apos;t jump back together , as i had expected .
and i grew more and more horri@@ fied .
and i was glad when i finally woke up and found myself bi@@ tten by mos@@ qui@@ toes .
in the mor@@ nings i &apos;d wake up and a lot of times i couldn &apos;t even see because the mos@@ qui@@ toes had eaten , had st@@ ung and my face was all s@@ wo@@ llen up .
then we just walked , for days and days like that .
there were a lot of air@@ planes in the air . they were looking for me , my buddies .
and i need to make a signal . i need to have some kind of device to signal to them .
and luckily at one time i spotted a small survival mirror in the to@@ bac@@ co pou@@ ch of one of my guards .
i hung around these guards all the time , because sometimes we would walk ... late in the evening .
it was total dark . my hands were tied .
a guard would be in front of me . my hands would be tied , they would go over his shoulder .
here , i had the right guard in front of me and very carefully , ever so carefully ,
i opened his pocket and i took this box out ...
den@@ gler succe@@ eded in stealing the mirror , and for the first time he spent the night in a hut .
my legs and my an@@ k@@ les would be tied together with a rope .
_removed_
they would feed me up here .
then when the sleeping time came i would lay down . a guard would be on my right
a guard would be on my left .
there would be rif@@ les there .
and that night i woke about 11 : 00@@ -@@ 12 : 00 in the morning because it was bitter , bitter cold .
i knew that it was the right time .
i kicked my ... legs up two or three times really hard . the pe@@ g gave way .
i came up , i unti@@ ed my legs slowly .
i came forward to the edge and very carefully i let myself down to the edge .
just when i hit the bottom , the pigs and the dogs and the chick@@ ens ran off .
there was a hell of a rac@@ ket . i quickly went back up . i laid down again .
_removed_
they kept on sno@@ ring , nobody noticed .
i tried it one more time ... and then i was free .
_removed_
but my target was a mountain .
a co@@ ar@@ se mountain just like that .
and that &apos;s what i was heading for .
i &apos;d seen that in the moon@@ light , but i didn &apos;t realize it was a co@@ ar@@ se mountain .
there was cre@@ vi@@ ces after cre@@ vice .
there was very , very sharp rock . it was very , very difficult to go up to this rock .
i finally got on top , there was no vege@@ tation on top .
that day nothing came .
they had stopped looking for me .
not a single air@@ plane . the only thing that really came was the sun . and it got hot .
i didn &apos;t count on that because i was for the last two weeks in the jungle .
it was cool down there , and i was already getting deli@@ rious and i was ...
i saw all those ... it was just terrible up there .
_removed_
i had saw ... seen a stin@@ king water@@ hole at the bottom of this hill and that was my target , because i knew water was the only thing that would make me survive .
his guards knew where to find him .
the moment he started to drink the pu@@ tri@@ d water , they were all over him .
from then on , the torture began .
they would hang him upside down and put an ant nest over his face until he lost consci@@ ousness .
for several nights , they suspended him into a well sha@@ ft , in such a way that he almost died a slow death from drowning .
but he was worth more to them alive .
he was their pri@@ zed possession .
and all of a sudden we came out of the jungle into an open area .
a real red-@@ du@@ sted area , there were about 30 guards standing there .
they had formed a circle .
i was dragged into the center of the circle and two north viet@@ name@@ se guys were standing there .
they hard their cap@@ s on , the red stars on it .
they had kha@@ ki uni@@ forms on .
they started yelling and screaming ... and start kicking me
and all of a sudden one of the guards came across the circle , walked towards me .
he had his rifle in his hand . the butt first .
_removed_
he sw@@ ung towards me . i moved my head .
he hit me in the shoulder , knocked me down on my back .
the gun went off .
and i clearly remember looking across , another one of the guards closed his eyes , fell backwards over .
he had no shirt on , he had just a lo@@ in@@ clo@@ th on .
i saw the blood coming out just above his kid@@ neys .
his buddy saw that , he took his gun , started shooting at this guy who shot this guy .
i &apos;m laying on the ground . all of a sudden bullets are flying .
there &apos;s screaming and yelling . they had forgotten about me .
i thought it was the end of me . i closed my eyes .
i waited for ... i waited to be shot myself .
i closed my eyes . i looked over . i saw someone wrap a lo@@ in@@ clo@@ th around this guy &apos;s wai@@ st .
you know , it was natural for them to be really angry at me now .
i had escaped from them , they had lost face , and they really wanted to get even .
whenever we were near the village , that &apos;s when they really became aggressive .
they had this new idea . my legs were tied up , my arms were tied up , my hands were tied up .
i was tied behind a water buff@@ alo .
they &apos;d hit the water buff@@ alo with a stick . he &apos;d start taking off .
i was hoping behind it . i was trying to keep my balance but pretty soon i fell over .
_removed_
they were kicking me in the face with the dust all the time .
they were kicking me@@ -@@ other guys would jump to my back .
the kids were laughing .
they thought it was just a lot of fun .
later on , they wanted me to sign something condem@@ ning the american aggre@@ ssion in vietnam .
i didn &apos;t sign it . i didn &apos;t believe in it .
they came up with this idea .
they stuck small , little ... pieces of ba@@ mbo@@ o underneath my finger@@ nails .
they cut my arms .
_removed_
they cut here .
they cut here . at various different places .
then one guy had this idea , they &apos;d put this rope around my upper arm .
like a tour@@ ni@@ quet , they put a piece of wood in there twisted and twisted it , until the nerves were cutting against the bone .
my hand would drop , and this hand was completely un@@ u@@ s@@ able for six months .
they were just always thinking of something to do to me .
it &apos;s christmas time in my home town in germany .
it &apos;s beautiful , all the decor@@ ations ...
it &apos;s like a christmas cal@@ en@@ dar .
but many , many years before , during the nazi time , it was a different story .
in fact , in this town , 100 % of the people voted for hitler .
except on person : my grandfather .
he was picked up at the house .
they hung signs around his neck saying that he was a traitor .
the parade on tin@@ sel@@ town .
there was a fan@@ fare of dru@@ ms and tru@@ mp@@ ets .
people sp@@ at out of the windows , water was pou@@ red on him .
and he fea@@ red for his life , he thought he was not going to live through it .
and for me , 30 years later when i was a pilot in vietnam .
i was a prisoner .
i was tortured and they wanted me to sign a piece of paper saying ... that i condem@@ ned the american action in vietnam .
and i was strong enough not to do that .
many times this strength came through my grandfather .
i was thinking of him ... and if he could do it , so could i do it .
oh oh . this feels a little bit too close to home .
of course , die@@ ter knew it was only a film , but all the old terror returned as if it were real .
i thought : &quot; you guys behind me with your camera can only see my back , &quot;
&quot; but you can &apos;t know how my heart is thu@@ mping inside . &quot;
i told myself : &quot; okay , play along with them . &quot;
&quot; running like this might chase the demons away . &quot;
almost everything that i learned in survival school back at ... in california , i couldn &apos;t use in the jungle .
i watched my guards , they taught me a lot .
they taught me how to set tr@@ aps . they taught me how to make fire .
in the jungle it &apos;s quite easy to find an old piece of ba@@ mbo@@ o .
which is right here .
you split it in half ...
and then you mount ... half in a ver@@ tical position .
you take four or five sticks and just ... to hold it into place .
then you take the other half ... and you need to cut a gro@@ ve in the other one , from the top .
cut this gro@@ ve just far enough in , so it just barely comes back on the other side .
then you take a mache@@ te ... or anything else , and you make some ... sc@@ rap@@ ings of the ba@@ mbo@@ o .
as you can see , it looks like a little wo@@ ol .
now , i have prepared this a little bit already , but you take this wo@@ ol ... and you put it over this crack , then you start ru@@ bbing .
okay .
being a prisoner , all of den@@ gler &apos;s thoughts were focused on another escape , and on survival .
back in the mi@@ d-@@ six@@ ties , american strate@@ gic thinking was turned against russia .
so , all survival meant survival in russia and si@@ ber@@ ia .
a jungle war didn &apos;t fac@@ tor much in their thinking .
and that &apos;s why their instru@@ ctional films look some@@ what funny .
you know , when it ra@@ ined that hard you didn &apos;t have to collect water .
of course , our man immediately comes across heart of palm .
_removed_
very important is ... that you have got a knife .
of course , our man also has his whe@@ t@@ stone on him .
and you better look hard for the enemy .
and now , the knife seems to be sharp as a ra@@ z@@ or .
you &apos;ve got to put it to the test .
a lea@@ f should slice easily in two .
now , if the lea@@ f doesn &apos;t cooperate , you can still chew it .
let &apos;s suppose you are wounded .
it &apos;s always smart to have your medicine kit on you .
you apply the right o@@ in@@ tment .
rub it in , sle@@ eve down , and done .
and it &apos;s a good idea to bring your radio transmi@@ tter along .
you make your position known to the planes above .
and then , you shoot a fl@@ are .
the rescue helicopter spot it , and you better scra@@ mble for a clea@@ ring .
the helicopter is already waiting .
but now , this is very odd .
what for god sake is our man sign@@ al@@ ing so fran@@ tically to the helicopter right above him ?
as we were walking through the jungle , we always had fire with us .
one of our guards had this little con@@ tainer on wi@@ res .
it was full of char@@ co@@ al . he would swing it back and forth so it wouldn &apos;t go out .
some of the other guards would have a fan made out of ba@@ mbo@@ o .
they would cut it on top with a mache@@ te , then they would beat it flat with a rock .
they knew exactly what r@@ ind to cut , some white sa@@ p would come out .
it was really sti@@ cky , they would s@@ m@@ ear it all over the surface here .
and as we were walking along , they would just see a small or a big bug way up on a branch or a lea@@ f .
they would reach up very carefully and the wings of this bug would stick on it .
they would take it off and they would lay it on top of this char@@ co@@ al .
and it wa@@ s-@@ we were walking along , they were barbe@@ cu@@ ing all the time .
in fact , one time i turned around and they had a small bird barbe@@ cu@@ ing .
when we got there in the evening , they weren &apos;t hungry .
i was shot down over la@@ os , and of course i was captured by the pa@@ the@@ t la@@ o .
we started walking towards the east , towards vietnam , and about 2 1 / 2 weeks later i was turned over to the viet@@ con@@ g .
even though later on i was kept in a pa@@ the@@ t la@@ o camp , it was clear to me that the north viet@@ name@@ se were running the show .
they were a different bre@@ ed of people , i was frightened of them .
they were very , very honest . they were very , very precise .
when i walked with them , we would come into a village ...
they would line up all the people . they would count the people .
they would write down the name of the village . they would look at their watch@@ es , it would be 7 : 28 .
they would know the time .
they would tie me down different at night .
there was no chance that i could escape .
in fact , there is one incident that &apos;s very vi@@ vid in my mind .
initi@@ ally , when i was captured ... they took everything away from me ... except my engagement ring .
i insisted on keeping it and they let me have it .
and here , about 2 1 / 2 or 3 weeks later we arrived in this village .
we came to a hut , it just looked something like this .
there was a villa@@ ger in the corner , he was cooking .
next thing , he &apos;s next to me .
he gave me a plate of rice . he smi@@ led at me , he was very friendly .
all of a sudden he gr@@ abs over , he gr@@ abs my hand .
he gets a hold of my ring and he starts pulling my ring off .
and of course i &apos;m pulling back . and it &apos;s going back and forth , and back and forth like that .
there was no way this guy &apos;s gonna get my ring .
he got up , he left . i thought it was all over .
all of a sudden , a few seconds later , he &apos;s coming back with a mache@@ te .
he ra@@ ises his arm .
i realized then i better let him have my ring .
the north viet@@ name@@ se , they were in a corner .
they were doing something over there , they were not aware what was happening . they got up .
got our stuff together , and off we went , we left .
i was disappointed . i was unhappy .
and the longer we walked , the an@@ gri@@ er i get .
and about 1 1 / 2 or 2 hours later i stopped them
i showed them my finger , it was all white where the ring had been .
at first they didn &apos;t understand what i was talking about .
i made stealing ge@@ stu@@ res .
they got together , they talked . then they turned around and started walking back towards this village . of course , i was happy .
i was thinking i &apos;m getting my ring back .
but i wasn &apos;t prepared for what happened next .
we got in this village ... next thing , they find this villa@@ ger , they just beat the hell out of this guy .
and then , they grabbed this guy &apos;s hand .
viol@@ ently they grabbed his hand .
they put it on top of the table , they put his finger there . they cho@@ pped his finger off !
i &apos;m le@@ aping back ! the blood is squir@@ ting out !
the ... finger &apos;s laying on the ground .
the north viet@@ name@@ se b@@ ends down , he pi@@ cks up this finger .
he pu@@ lls off this ring , he sticks it on my finger .
i was spee@@ ch@@ less . i caused this misery , i felt horrible .
he no@@ d@@ ded to me , we turned around , we walked off .
i realized right then and there , you just don &apos;t fool around with the viet@@ con@@ gs .
it &apos;s just a movie . don &apos;t worry about it .
and you still got your fingers and everything .
finally , after 3 1 / 2 weeks i arrived at a prison camp .
i looked forward to coming to the camp .
i had been beaten so much . i lost so much blood .
i had been unconscious so many times .
i wanted to share my misery with someone else .
other pi@@ lots . i was hoping to see someone , maybe meet someone i have known before .
maybe a doctor would be there , but it was totally different than what i expected .
first of all , i thought i was all alone in this ... this camp .
high ba@@ mbo@@ o walls on the side .
the hu@@ ts were built out of grass and out of ba@@ mbo@@ o .
i was let in , they threw me into one of the hu@@ ts .
and only three hours later they opened the door and let the other guys come out .
i couldn &apos;t believe my eyes , the first guy was carrying his inte@@ stin@@ es around in his hand .
there was six of them .
there were 4 tha@@ is , 2 americans ...
du@@ ane martin who became my friend later on .
the next guy came out , he had no teeth .
with a ru@@ sty nail and a rock they would knock each other &apos;s teeth in ... to let the pu@@ ss out .
they &apos;d been there 2 1 / 2 years . it was just awful .
i looked at them and i realized that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m gonna look in six months .
_removed_
we needed the water to drink .
at nights we would be hand@@ cu@@ ffed .
sometimes we would get cross-@@ hand@@ cu@@ ffed , sometimes straigh@@ t-@@ hand@@ cu@@ ffed .
cross-@@ hand@@ cu@@ ffed , this is a more modern hand@@ cu@@ ff , would be like that .
left wrist would go to the right wrist of the guy on my right .
my right wrist would go to the left wrist of the guy on my left .
this way we &apos;d be together .
_removed_
twenty times a night , this guy made the motion , this guy had to make the motion .
on top of it , our legs were in foot blocks , big wood@@ en blocks they made .
our feet would be driven through there , a pin would come in between .
some sides were be longer , sometimes it would be shor@@ ter .
and this is the way they expected you to sleep .
if you had no blan@@ kets it was miserable cold .
in the misery of those nights ,
den@@ gler often dreamt of oce@@ ans and foreign sho@@ res .
and i dreamt that a boat appeared .
and the whole american navy came to rescue me .
and i wa@@ ved . and i shou@@ ted .
but they wouldn &apos;t listen .
they just kept on going and went somewhere else .
as far as food , they themselves were very poor .
at the beginning we were given a hand@@ ful of rice , then later on a ...
a hand@@ ful of rice for all of us .
sometimes they would catch a deer .
they would cut a deer open , they would take the grass out from the inside .
that &apos;s what we would get to eat .
they would keep the meat . they would take the meat and stuff it in a ba@@ mbo@@ o con@@ tainer .
after 4 or 5 days it would rot so bad for themselves . they would come in with a towel
they would pour it out , it would be white , it was covered sma@@ ck , and it would stink to high heaven .
first time i tried it i vo@@ mi@@ ted . but if you didn &apos;t eat it , you just died .
we were luck , though , because we couldn &apos;t go to the bathroom .
so , once every 3 or 4 weeks they would let us out .
we would go to the bathroom right below us , it would stink to high heaven .
i mean it was awful , but there were rats down there .
and we couldn &apos;t catch the rats , but there was a snake there .
and every so often we were lucky to catch that snake .
we would look , we would lay on our be@@ lli@@ es , we watched this snake line up on the rat .
get a hold of the rat .
we had a stick , we would get the snake , we pulled the snake up , we pulled the rat out .
we cut the rat apart and everybody got his share .
we lost , of course , a lot of weight waiting for the rain to come .
but ... we had to supp@@ lement our food for the day that we left for freedom .
well , initi@@ ally ... initi@@ ally , february or march ... we were allowed to go to the bathroom in the morning ... for about two minutes .
and ... we had ...
we have a couple of tu@@ bes you go in at night and you can imagine you &apos;re in a big block in the woods , and you &apos;re hand@@ cu@@ ffed like that and you got to go to the bathroom at night
with a guy having di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a or dy@@ sen@@ tery .
so , it was a real mess , but while we walked down , we run down like hell .
there &apos;s about a 20 or 30 foot walk to the hole .
and while we did this they ... they shot at us .
and it got so close that some of the prisoners came back with black in the face , or grea@@ sed their hair with a bullet , and ...
so , we didn &apos;t even want to go anymore . we ... we rather stayed with the tu@@ bes .
the question is : &quot; why were they shooting at ya ? &quot;
just hara@@ ssment .
they will take a gun and they &apos;d show it to you , they put a ... a round in it and they put it right onto your head and they ... take the safety off and they go :
_removed_
so ... i &apos;m lucky to be here !
the camp was inside la@@ os , and the shor@@ test way out would have been east to the ocean .
but there were imp@@ ass@@ able mountains and , of course , north vietnam .
what made most sense for them was to go west .
to flo@@ at down the river to the me@@ kong , and then cross to freedom in tha@@ il@@ and .
our plan to escape from this prison camp was planned right down to the last detail .
we had six months , we &apos;re waiting for the mon@@ soon rain .
we had a little problem amongst ourselves .
some of the prisoners didn &apos;t want to escape .
in 196@@ 6 there was really no war in la@@ os .
they were hoping to be released pretty soon , and also they were afraid to be shot on the way out .
this changed pretty dra@@ ma@@ tically , real quick , because the tha@@ is , who spoke the language , in this hut over@@ heard the guards outside talking about that they would take us in the jungle , shoot us so it would look like we &apos;d escaped
because they wanted to go home anyway , because they had hardly anything else to eat .
of course , now we all thought alike .
and we had to move really , really quick .
and the plan was that if i would make it out of my hut ... into this hut over here , without being seen , the other guys would follow me .
now , we had ... for the last 2 or 3 weeks , we had a little dia@@ gram .
we had little squ@@ a@@ res with names on it for the people and the rif@@ les .
we would look through the crac@@ ks . we would observe them . we would listen to them .
and pretty soon we knew exactly where every rifle was , where every person was , because this was very , very important .
that they would all be in the kitchen at the same time , because our plan was that while they were in the kitchen we would en@@ circle them .
we would capture them .
lock &apos; em up . hold the camp
signal the air@@ planes at night and be rescu@@ ed right out of there .
now , during the day there was only one time that we could do this .
we had about two minutes , 1@@ 20 seconds to do this .
_removed_
food time ! &quot;
only then would the guards leave their rif@@ les behind .
the next problem was to get out of the hand@@ cuffs .
it &apos;s quite simple . nowadays everybody ought to know how to open a hand@@ cu@@ ff .
if you come a little closer with your camera i can show you how to do that .
with this small key , i &apos;m gonna open the hand@@ cu@@ ff to show you the fun@@ ctions inside .
as you look in there , you see this small spring going back and forth .
you &apos;ll also see a few teeth in there that holds the hand@@ cu@@ ff in place .
now , just with a regular paper@@ cli@@ p ... you can open this hand@@ cu@@ ff quite simply by in@@ ser@@ ting ... one of these ends into the opening .
apply pressure to the spring , pulling the hand@@ cu@@ ff open .
the day came .
the cook ye@@ lled : &quot; c@@ how time ! &quot;
i stri@@ pped my blocks , i let myself to the floor .
i was underneath my hut now . i craw@@ led quickly over to the lo@@ gs , those heavy lo@@ gs that i had to lift out .
_removed_
my heart was really p@@ ounding . i craw@@ led across . i came to this fence .
i unti@@ ed the ra@@ tt@@ an . slipped the ba@@ mbo@@ o up and ru@@ shed through this door and i le@@ aped into this hut .
there were three rif@@ les in there , two i passed away , and the other one i kept .
i ran out into the open . nobody came out from this side except the guards running in my direction .
they must have heard or seen the other guys .
this big shoot@@ out started .
all of a sudden the bullets were flying . somehow we had mi@@ sca@@ l@@ cu@@ lated .
somebody had a rifle in there .
i had this sub@@ -@@ machine gun in my hand . i never shot one before .
when i pulled the trigger it practically flew out of my hand .
it raised up like that and this allowed them to close this distance real quick .
they came within 2 or 3 feet from me .
the moron , one of the guys , had a mache@@ te in his hand .
he came within 4 or 5 feet , i shot him through the hip .
it li@@ fted him up , it threw him down to the ground .
next thing i &apos;m looking up , he &apos;s getting up again .
he still had the mache@@ te , he &apos;s still coming at me . of course this time i couldn &apos;t miss he was right 2 or 3 feet in front of me .
i couldn &apos;t believe it .
i didn &apos;t have a scratch . there was five dead guards laying on the ground .
two of them got away .
they ran a z@@ ig@@ za@@ g pattern and they got in the jungle .
i knew then , right then and there , they would get help ... and we had to get out of there .
where was du@@ ane ? i saw him behind this bush over here , he had vo@@ mi@@ ted .
i ye@@ lled to him : &quot; du@@ ane , let &apos;s get out of here ! let &apos;s get out of here ! &quot;
we took off . we ran down between this kitchen . we run ... ran amongst those dead guys laying on the ground .
and it was very important because our shoes were tied together in a bun@@ dle , were hanging on this hut over here .
the shoes we needed in the jungle but when we got there .
they were already taken . the other guys must have taken them and run off with them .
and then , du@@ ane and i , we had no choice but to turn around , ba@@ re@@ foot we ran into the jungle .
of the seven of us that escaped , i was the only one that came out alive .
the other ones disappeared in the jungle and nobody ever heard from them again .
god ! how did i ever make it through this jungle , ba@@ re@@ foot , for weeks .
i &apos;ll never know .
die@@ ter and du@@ ane were stru@@ ggling to make their way through the jungle .
weak and star@@ ved , their feet badly cut by thor@@ ns .
after ten days they reached a river , some@@ what like this one .
only the river was much higher because of the mon@@ soon ra@@ ins .
we were ec@@ sta@@ tic . we felt like dancing and we thought that this was our highway to freedom .
exhausted as they were , they managed to build a small ra@@ ft and climb@@ ed aboard .
there we were on this river , this beautiful river , dri@@ fting down between hills and mountains for a cou@@ ple@@ - hour and a half , down towards tha@@ il@@ and .
i thought i heard something . i said :
&quot; du@@ ane , do you hear anything ? &quot;
but then it got quiet again , but when we came a ... around the next hill , we heard it at the same time .
we both ye@@ lled : &quot; water@@ falls ! &quot; he le@@ aped off .
i jumped in the water . i was actually in the water , i grabbed the rif@@ les .
i kicked as hard as i could .
i was taken off . i was going then towards ... this side .
du@@ ane was already nearly over there , but i had these rif@@ les in my arm and i couldn &apos;t really swim that fast .
_removed_
and i thought i wouldn &apos;t make it and finally there was a couple of rocks sticking out .
i cl@@ ung on this rock and i looked over the side and ... our ra@@ ft had tu@@ mbled and tu@@ mbled and tu@@ mbled down 300 feet .
it di@@ sin@@ te@@ gra@@ ted on the bottom .
i was spee@@ ch@@ less . i looked at du@@ ane , he was sno@@ w-@@ white .
we had just ... escaped death i mean it was truly touch and go .
we were spee@@ ch@@ less .
we just sat there after i made it to shore . trying to decide what to do .
one of the rif@@ les , we threw away .
it was ver@@ tical going down , on both sides .
we had a very difficult , because it was full of green m@@ oss .
full of green mud during the ra@@ iny season .
the ground was very mu@@ ddy and on the vin@@ es we were sli@@ ding down , helping each other down .
and late in the evening we arrived on the bottom .
we were totally exhausted . we were totally di@@ si@@ ll@@ u@@ si@@ oned .
then ba@@ re@@ foot , over rocks and sticks we ...
down the river we went , looking forward towards freedom .
to this day , i often think about du@@ ane martin .
we shared so many hard@@ ships , hopes and desp@@ air .
and this made us grow very close .
by the end , du@@ ane was closer to me than anyone else in my life .
even closer than my mother and my brothers .
behind me is the me@@ kong .
we called it &quot; the big mu@@ ddy &quot; .
over there is la@@ os . i was a prisoner of war over here .
over here is tha@@ il@@ and . freedom .
we talked about this river so many times .
we dreamt about this river . this river was our target .
but we never reached it .
when i think about it now , even though it &apos;s over 30 years ago , it &apos;s just like it happened yesterday .
i remember , du@@ ane and i , we had ... nearly star@@ ved to death when we escaped the camp .
we were ba@@ re@@ foot in the jungle within the first mile our feet were cut to sh@@ re@@ ds .
in fact , they swe@@ lled up to big white stu@@ mps .
we had found a single sole of a tennis shoe .
and we alter@@ na@@ ted wearing it , and we would tie it to one of our foot with ra@@ tt@@ an .
and then came the mon@@ soon .
the mon@@ soon is something else .
i mean , you have to really be there to ... to know what i &apos;m talking about .
it &apos;s just dea@@ f@@ ening . you can scream on top of your lungs and nobody can hear you .
the water comes down like somebody turned on ... a bath@@ tub .
it goes for hours , for days .
the mud ! the ba@@ mbo@@ o !
all the stuff the comes down from the mountains .
in fact , du@@ ane and i , we had to look for high grounds .
we tie ourselves down to a stu@@ mp or trees .
not to be swe@@ pt down with this mud overnight . of course , we would hug each other .
we needed each other for war@@ m@@ th .
we needed each other for friendship in this misery .
and then came dawn . i would look over there and i couldn &apos;t even recognize du@@ ane .
du@@ ane would be covered from top to bottom with mud and blood .
i looked the same .
we had le@@ e@@ ches , not 20 , not 50 .
_removed_
it was like a belt . it was black around there . our legs were covered with le@@ e@@ ches .
they were looking for the soft spots .
between our fingers , underneath the arms , and the nose and the ears .
it was awful .
they &apos;re tiny , tiny creatures . like a needle , they find ever tiny , little hole .
they att@@ ach themselves , they suck themselves full with blood , as big as this finger .
we would then take our ra@@ gs off , we would take ba@@ mbo@@ o and we sc@@ raped them off , and on we went .
but then , there were a couple of times we thought we really had it made .
one time , we built a ra@@ ft . we had to abandon the ra@@ ft .
the ra@@ ft went over the water@@ fall . but then , later on we made this beautiful fire .
we wa@@ ved at night to the air@@ planes . they saw us , they cir@@ cl@@ ed over@@ head .
and we knew , we &apos;re gonna be rescu@@ ed , that next morning .
we were e@@ lated . we hu@@ gged each other , we cried together .
we talked about who &apos;s going in the helicopter first .
what are we gonna eat .
who are we gonna call .
and then morning came , and we waited and waited , and nothing happened .
it was a blow . what a disappoin@@ tment .
but then we had to move on because we were starving to death .
in fact , we couldn &apos;t even walk anymore .
we were craw@@ ling and lay on our knees around this small little trail .
and all of a sudden there was this small boy on our left .
he was carrying a water con@@ tainer over his shoulder .
and all of a sudden , there was all this com@@ motion . people were running ... all over each way . there was noise .
du@@ ane and i right away were on our knees and we put our hands together .
we said : &quot; hello . sab@@ ai . &quot;
du@@ ane then starts sitting back and started getting up .
and all of a sudden out of the corner of my eye i saw something .
i looked over there , a villa@@ ger was standing there . he had a mache@@ te in his hand , high above his head .
he just hesi@@ tated for a second and then he sw@@ ung .
he sw@@ ung for me , i du@@ cked , it missed me by a few inches .
he hit du@@ ane in the upper leg , the blade was deeply buried .
and then du@@ ane screa@@ med . he reached down , he grabbed his leg , screaming !
and with the next swi@@ pe ... du@@ ane &apos;s head came off .
blood squir@@ ting out ! i start screaming .
i le@@ aped towards this villa@@ ger . he turned around , he ran . in fact , they all started running
and unknown to me , i had reached down and grabbed this rubber sole from his foot .
i turned around and ran , where thirty seconds before i was craw@@ ling along .
du@@ ane , my friend , he was gone .
and from then on , my mo@@ tions , my progress , became mechani@@ cal .
in fact , i couldn &apos;t care less if i would live or die .
but then later on , there was this bear .
this beautiful bear that was following me .
it was cir@@ cl@@ ing me . in fact , sometimes when it was gone , i missed it .
it was just like a dog . it was just like a pet .
of course , i knew , this bear was there , he was waiting to eat me .
when i think about it ... this bear meant death to me .
and it is really ir@@ onic ...
that the only friend i had in the end was death .
how die@@ ter den@@ gler has been able to cope with all this remains a mystery .
he hi@@ des behind the ca@@ sual re@@ mark that this was the fun part of his life .
die@@ ter took an early retirement from the armed forces and became a civilian test pilot .
he survived four more cra@@ shes , and flies to this day .
death did not want him .
- what &apos;s that , about 20 pounds ?
- no , 30 actually . -@@ 30 pounds .
my god , he &apos;ll be surprised .
how long did it take to cook that thing ?
- a good five hours . - five hours .
die@@ ter !
god , my suspici@@ ons were true !
- it &apos;s good to see you !
- happy thanksgiving , friend !
this is eu@@ gene dea@@ trick , to whom die@@ ter den@@ gler ultima@@ tely owes his life .
die@@ ter wanted to surprise him on thanksgiving .
i wouldn &apos;t be here without you and i really appreciate what you did for me .
- and that you followed it up and ... - sit down , tell me all about it .
my god ! you &apos;re losing hair .
both of them . tell me did you have any suspici@@ on , even a little bit ?
i had a little bit .
you don &apos;t come down here for ... no one telling you what it is , but by god it &apos;s good to see you .
all right , i haven &apos;t done that too many times , but ...
what a turkey .
_removed_
andy and i started to take off that morning .
i have said many times to people that this was a million in one shot .
if everything hadn &apos;t gone exactly right we never would have found you .
just step by step .
we were late getting off .
supposed to leave at eight .
didn &apos;t get off until about noon or 1 : 00 .
we came up and it was an armed wre@@ cking area .
which meant that you could bomb anything in the area if you thought it was enemy .
and i left andy high , to stay in contact with dan@@ ang .
and i went down on the deck .
and i saw this big boy river coming out of the mountain .
and i thought i &apos;ll go up that as a first shot .
and again , if it hadn &apos;t been that you were right in the bend , because as you fly straight i couldn &apos;t see down .
but just where you were there was a bend in the river .
i made that 90 degree bank and - looked down and there on that rock ...
- a split second ! and this nut sitting down there wa@@ ving at me .
and i thought that was nice and flew on .
i must have gone 5 or 10 minutes and i &apos;ll never know whatever made me come back .
but something just didn &apos;t settle right , that ...
i guess you , it wasn &apos;t a conscious effort , but ...
na@@ tives don &apos;t ...
- hang on and wave to you . - wave to me on a fully loaded air@@ plane .
so , i came back and when you were there a second time wa@@ ving ...
i really wasn &apos;t sure what it was ...
you know that piece of white material , you know where it came from ?
- the fl@@ are . - the fl@@ are .
actually , it wasn &apos;t the fl@@ are .
about five days before ...
you know , i had gone down to a village , and the americans saw it and dropped fla@@ res , and it was one of those par@@ ac@@ hu@@ tes .
and i had already given up ... it looked like fishing ne@@ ts from where i was .
well i &apos;ll tell ya . i pulled that sucker down and i had that thing in my little back@@ pack
and when i heard an air@@ plane i didn &apos;t even look up .
all i could do is reach back there . that &apos;s when i pulled that white piece of material out .
i was thinking : &quot; so@@ s . so@@ s . &quot;
&quot; how does it go , does the s go this way ?
or the s go this way ? &quot; and i ripped my pants off , trying to lay it down .
and every so often i would look up and you were way in the corner between the clouds .
i thought : &quot; oh god . please don &apos;t let him leave . please don &apos;t let him leave . &quot;
- i was laying out this so@@ s ...
- and as i came back around the next time
i asked andy if he could see anything , and that &apos;s when he saw the par@@ ac@@ hu@@ te and said : &quot; it looks like he has an so@@ s . &quot; well that ... gave us both the clue that ... someone was down there , and the fact that you were there after three passes ...
so , we pulled off to the side and i called the crown aircraft , which is the
c-@@ 12@@ 1 contro@@ ller in that area .
and i asked them if anyone had been shot down .
they said there was no air force , no navy , no marine , no la@@ o@@ ti@@ ans , no tha@@ i .
_removed_
_removed_
but we finally got approval and they got the rescue helicop@@ ters , two of them .
and the aircraft on the coast esc@@ or@@ ted them in . i took the lead helicopter when they got in sight .
put him down and told him where you were , and went out .
and that &apos;s when he dropped his long range tank up the river from you .
that &apos;s the first time i realized it was for real .
because you know , i was hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ating all this time
and when i sme@@ lled that ga@@ so@@ line i knew it was for real .
and ... he couldn &apos;t get down very low because of the mountain .
and he dropped the pen@@ e@@ tra@@ tor cable down and i saw you climb@@ ing aboard .
and it was then that my heart began to beat , i &apos;ll tell you .
well you know , i couldn &apos;t even pull down the zi@@ p on the pen@@ e@@ tra@@ tor .
i had it in my ar@@ mp@@ it as i was going up .
the helicopter had come in and all the trees and the bu@@ shes
blowing me around down there and i had a hard time catching that .
as i was going up i was just going around and around .
they were taking off because the viet@@ con@@ gs , they were shooting up at them .
the guys up there had the machine guns , not only on them but also on me , because they thought that i might be a viet@@ con@@ g .
they probably had the same idea i had .
not recogni@@ zing die@@ ter as an american , and fea@@ ring he might be a viet@@ con@@ g on a suicide mission , a black corporal on board the helicopter threw his weight of 300 pounds upon the ske@@ leton that was left of die@@ ter , and wre@@ st@@ led him to the floor .
the previous day die@@ ter had seen a snake swimming in the water , and had bi@@ tten it in two from hun@@ ger .
searching for explosives , the corporal pulled out half a snake from under die@@ ter &apos;s shirt .
it gave him such a shock that he fell halfway out of the helicopter , and had to be rescu@@ ed himself .
so , as he started to pull away and i saw you going in , and the thing didn &apos;t blow up ,
i gave a great si@@ gh of relief , i &apos;ll tell you that !
that scared me . i thought my career would be over if that ...
and as they went away i asked &apos; em if they could identify you .
and they said that they didn &apos;t know who it was but he claimed that he was a navy lieutenant that had been shot down several months before .
and i &apos;ll tell you , my heart gave a si@@ gh of relief .
die@@ ter wanted to be back with the fle@@ et , back on his ship .
he had been taken to the hospital in dan@@ ang .
he was safe now , but he was sure this was only a dream .
for him , this was just a mi@@ rage .
he wanted to run , and they had to tie him to his bed .
so , his friends came and snu@@ ck him out and brought him back to the carri@@ er .
the elevator took him down to the han@@ ger bay .
it was a dri@@ zz@@ ly day , and there had been hardly anyone on deck .
but there was something strange , something almost e@@ erie about the fact that no one was there .
unknown to myself , the admiral had asse@@ mbled about ... 4@@ 000 people up here in the han@@ ger bay .
they were waiting for me and i was thinking that nobody would know that i was alive
that this was going to be a total surprise .
so , the air@@ plane was ... the engine was turned off .
the air@@ plane was pulled in here .
we came over here . there was just a ... load of these people .
4@@ 000 guys were waiting . they opened ... the door , there was a red carpet .
and the yelling and the screaming started .
it was such an emotional moment . i just can &apos;t really describe it .
the tears ! all my friends that i &apos;d been through flight training with . norman , spo@@ ok ...
far@@ cas , li@@ zard . they all were there .
tears were rolling ... hu@@ gging .
and finally , i was on the aircraft carri@@ er , they were all my buddies .
the other pi@@ lots there , they did everything they could for me .
it was just un@@ real . the admiral packed his bag .
he left . he said : &quot; die@@ ter , my quarters are your quarters . &quot; i slept in his bed .
at nights i would have dreams , i would yell and scream .
my friends would tie me down , they even got afraid of me sometimes .
so , they finally figured it out and they would take me up in a cock@@ pit .
at nights they would take me up on top of the carri@@ er deck and they would pack me into a cock@@ pit , put two or three pi@@ llows next to me .
that &apos;s where i felt safe . that &apos;s where i felt ... truly , truly safe .
and then i would sleep in there .
in fact , later on when i was on different ba@@ ses , sometimes at nights i would come down and i would go to an aircraft cock@@ pit , and i would just bed in there and i would sleep in there .
and i brought you here to show you all these air@@ planes .
i mean , this is a heaven for pi@@ lots . i mean , just look around .
in every directions there &apos;s just miles , and miles and miles of air@@ planes . everywhere !
here , miles and miles ...
god ! look at the cock@@ pi@@ ts !
these are just fantastic !
these are just really , really , truly beautiful .
and one could really feel at home here .
this is just a heaven for a pilot .
previously on &quot; ali@@ as &quot; ...
neil cap@@ lan .
he &apos;s a mathe@@ ma@@ ti@@ cian out of cal@@ tech .
the bureau confirmed he and his family were kidnapped from the long beach aqu@@ ari@@ um yesterday .
if you want me to help you , you let my family go .
all i need to know now is whether you want to come with me .
yes .
i didn &apos;t have a clean shot .
and i took it anyway .
i &apos;m putting in for rea@@ ssi@@ g@@ nment to the dire@@ ct@@ or@@ ate of intelligence .
if i had the shot , i might have taken it .
i know what emily meant to you .
i &apos;m sorry .
ar@@ vin ?
ar@@ vin ?
this plan might not hold up .
the cia knows too much .
they could guess why we were after the gene@@ tic da@@ tab@@ a@@ se .
i &apos;m not interested in the da@@ tab@@ a@@ se .
i want satellite footage of tu@@ sc@@ any .
i want to know who murdered my wife .
we both had to make sacrifi@@ ces , ar@@ vin .
you won &apos;t forgive yourself if you stop now .
we &apos;re so close to knowing what ra@@ mb@@ al@@ di knew .
i wish i never heard that man &apos;s name .
good news , rela@@ tively speaking .
using the admini@@ stra@@ tive codes we acqui@@ red at bru@@ cker ,
i was able to down@@ load a copy of the da@@ tab@@ a@@ se .
but it &apos;s still en@@ cry@@ pted ? yes .
although neil cap@@ lan &apos;s still analy@@ zing the rema@@ in@@ der of the ra@@ mb@@ al@@ di text , his background should allow him to crack the al@@ gori@@ th@@ ms .
i don &apos;t understand how we don &apos;t have a single lead on slo@@ ane or mom .
there &apos;s a difference between intelligence and ac@@ tion@@ able intelligence .
what about the ear@@ rings mom left me ?
analysis couldn &apos;t trace the source .
marshall &apos;s trying to figure out how they receive anything .
we have to get ahead of them .
we know they &apos;re acqui@@ ring ra@@ mb@@ al@@ di arti@@ facts .
we know they tried to access a dna da@@ tab@@ a@@ se .
there must be some way to predi@@ ct what they &apos;re gonna do .
i understand your fru@@ stration in light of emily &apos;s death .
but sometimes there isn &apos;t a clear move to make .
look at this .
el@@ sa cap@@ lan &apos;s de@@ brief tran@@ script .
it &apos;s barely 10 pages long .
slo@@ ane kidnapped her husband 2 months ago .
all we have are 10 pages ?
if you feel el@@ sa cap@@ lan was impro@@ per@@ ly de@@ brief@@ ed , do it again yourself .
how &apos;s your son ?
he &apos;s keeping me sane .
even with the security detail , it &apos;s hard to feel safe .
i don &apos;t want to make this more difficult for you .
but i need a little more of your help .
i &apos;d like to bring you in for a regre@@ ssion@@ -@@ therapy session .
it &apos;s like hy@@ p@@ nos@@ is .
it &apos;s completely safe . i &apos;ve done it myself .
no offense , but i don &apos;t feel comfortable with the government po@@ king around in my head .
_removed_
we &apos;re out of leads .
what are you saying ?
that if something happens to him , it &apos;s my fault ?
of course not .
these people threatened to kill my son .
- he &apos;s still having nightmares .
- wait .
you come and tell me i &apos;m not doing enough ?
- that &apos;s not what i meant .
- aaron , come on .
it &apos;s time to go .
how dare you .
sweetie , honey , it &apos;s time to go .
we still need your help .
i &apos;ve just down@@ loaded this .
it &apos;s a catal@@ o@@ g of over 10 million people &apos;s dna .
we &apos;re looking for someone specific . a man .
but it &apos;s en@@ cry@@ pted .
we need you to break it .
for the past two months ,
i haven &apos;t heard a word about my family or been given any indi@@ cation whether they &apos;re dead or alive , so ... you can just kill me .
just kill me , &apos; cause there &apos;s no way
i &apos;m gonna help you anymore .
what if i told you that your family &apos;s not only alive , but we let them go ?
call your house .
call .
el@@ sa !
it &apos;s me .
el@@ sa !
el@@ sa , i &apos;m alive .
she can &apos;t hear you .
i &apos;ve modi@@ fied the cell@@ phone .
they &apos;re home .
they &apos;re safe .
now you have something to live for , mr. cap@@ lan .
el@@ sa cap@@ lan was living under prote@@ ctive custody for two months .
i was so convinced that we were over@@ looking something that i went there and imp@@ lied that she wasn &apos;t doing enough to save her husband .
how stupid .
no one &apos;s harder on themselves than you are .
va@@ ugh@@ n , i mean , okay .
the back@@ pack is getting ridiculous .
what do you mean ?
the middle drawer ... it &apos;s yours .
it &apos;s just a drawer .
i &apos;m just saying it &apos;s a great idea .
you sure ?
i love my drawer .
if we &apos;re gonna keep working , i need to make a sandwich .
there were three calls made from the same number to cap@@ lan &apos;s house over the last year .
they came exactly four months apart .
they were all made on a monday night at the same time .
and they all lasted one minute .
where did the calls come from ?
i need to talk to you .
is it neil ?
before neil &apos;s abdu@@ ction , three calls were made to your house over the last year at odd hours .
we trac@@ ed the number to a reporter named greg@@ ory i@@ van@@ ov .
does that name mean anything to you ?
no .
we ran a background check .
he was a journalist out of los angeles for i@@ tar@@ -@@ ta@@ ss , a news service known for giving cover to russian intelligence agents .
this man , i@@ van@@ ov ... we think he &apos;s one of them .
we put i@@ van@@ ov under electr@@ onic surveillance .
an hour ago , he received a fax from an unknown source .
i don &apos;t understand .
your husband may have been working for the russian s v@@ r .
it &apos;s their equi@@ val@@ ent to the cia .
what did the fax say ?
a single russian word ...
it means &quot; en@@ d@@ game . &quot;
neil &apos;s gonna die .
- el@@ sa , we don &apos;t know that . - no .
i do .
not you ?
i didn &apos;t want to be hy@@ p@@ noti@@ zed because i was afraid you &apos;d find out .
i@@ van@@ ov was my hand@@ ler .
seven years ago , i was ordered to sedu@@ ce and marry neil .
my objective was to keep tab@@ s on his work .
i was given a tracking device to imp@@ lant in his arm .
but it has a secon@@ dary purpose .
it was designed to release 50 milli@@ grams of cy@@ ani@@ de into his blood@@ stream .
it &apos;s a suicide pill .
that &apos;s what the fax was about .
it means it &apos;s been acti@@ vated .
you &apos;re not authorized to be telling me this ?
i &apos;ve just committed t@@ reason against my government because i want to get him back .
i &apos;m telling you because i love him .
i have a lead on slo@@ ane and i@@ rin@@ a .
- we have to move immediately .
- va@@ ugh@@ n brief@@ ed me .
el@@ sa cap@@ lan shouldn &apos;t be proce@@ ssed as a wal@@ k-@@ in .
she &apos;s an s v@@ r agent .
which means we can classi@@ fy her as a defe@@ ctor .
or we can arrest her and try her for e@@ spi@@ on@@ age .
until we make that determin@@ ation , i &apos;m holding her .
she wants to help .
she imp@@ lan@@ ted a tracking chip in her husband .
the chip &apos;s acti@@ vated by a code .
if we get a lo@@ cating device , we can enter the code , find him , and remove the device before it relea@@ ses the cy@@ ani@@ de .
i &apos;ve asked marshall to look into the possibility of rever@@ se@@ -@@ engine@@ ering a lo@@ ca@@ tor .
it &apos;ll take him three days .
cap@@ lan will be dead by then .
the chip &apos;s set to release cy@@ ani@@ de in 42 hours .
there &apos;s a black@@ -@@ market contact who deals in s v@@ r contr@@ ab@@ and .
i &apos;m going to meet him .
i &apos;m not willing to risk your life based on spe@@ cu@@ la@@ tive intel you acqui@@ red from a russian spy .
- why would she lie ?
- that &apos;s the question .
- she turned herself in .
- she &apos;s not the first .
i realize we &apos;re talking about a russian agent who betrayed her husband , but el@@ sa cap@@ lan and my mother are not the same person .
el@@ sa &apos;s first instinct , her first thought , was for her husband &apos;s life .
that &apos;s your asse@@ ssment .
if we find neil cap@@ lan , we find slo@@ ane and dere@@ v@@ ko .
isn &apos;t that worth the risk ?
we &apos;ll move on el@@ sa &apos;s statement only if we can cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ate it .
when did you start playing it safe ?
you let dere@@ v@@ ko walk out of here because you thought she could lead us to slo@@ ane .
a mistake i &apos;m not anxious to repeat .
and if neil cap@@ lan dies ?
then he dies .
who has my son ?
- he &apos;s being taken care of .
- i thought you believed me .
- i do believe you .
- why am i in this cell ?
i ris@@ ked everything , committed t@@ reason against my own government .
it &apos;s not that simple . there are protoco@@ ls to follow .
this is director bri@@ sto@@ w .
i want soli@@ tary con@@ fin@@ ement imp@@ osed on el@@ sa cap@@ lan .
no un@@ approved visitors . understood ?
we still have 42 hours .
we &apos;re doing everything we can ...
el@@ sa , don &apos;t react .
you &apos;re listening to a recorded message being transmi@@ tted through a dire@@ ctional sound proje@@ ctor .
you &apos;re the only one who can hear this .
the cia won &apos;t san@@ ction a team to get the lo@@ ca@@ tor .
i &apos;m going in myself .
i know none of this is much of a con@@ so@@ lation to you ...
i need you to give me the lo@@ ca@@ tor codes .
cross your arms and tap them out in morse code .
back away from the glass , please .
i have authori@@ zation .
back up now .
thank you .
it &apos;s been 24 hours .
this da@@ tab@@ a@@ se is en@@ co@@ ded with an 8@@ 19@@ 2-@@ bit mili@@ tar@@ y-@@ grade poly@@ mor@@ phi@@ c en@@ cry@@ ption .
now , unless you want to kid@@ nap a smarter genius , it &apos;s gonna be a little while .
tell me what you need to speed this up .
i need access to a cr@@ ay super@@ computer .
i hope you &apos;re not stal@@ ling , mr. cap@@ lan .
because your safe return to your family is no guarantee .
understand ?
- a few days ago ...
- oh , my leg !
i would have done anything to keep you alive .
my leg ...
and now ... i don &apos;t care .
ar@@ vin .
ar@@ vin , don &apos;t .
we still need him .
my leg .
where would you be transferred to ?
i &apos;ll be rea@@ ssi@@ g@@ ned within the agency , maybe to texas or d.@@ c .
i &apos;d be an analy@@ st .
i would be safe .
you &apos;d be happy not being in the field ?
i &apos;d be happy .
as long as you and the kids are with me .
slo@@ ane &apos;s the man who ran sd-6 .
the one who lied to you for years .
marcus .
you are not responsible for what happened to his wife .
he put her in harm &apos;s way .
that &apos;s not the only reason i &apos;m putting in for the transfer .
i &apos;m doing it for us .
when you first told me the truth ,
i said i didn &apos;t know who you were .
i was wrong .
i just didn &apos;t know what you did .
i have always known who you are .
you are the most decent man i know .
whatever you decide ...
i &apos;ll be with you .
it &apos;s me .
is your source still in place ?
yes .
good .
i need something from him .
base ops , this is trailer . we have a 20 on the target .
copy . stay with her .
we &apos;re gonna head over to the p@@ i del@@ ta exchange .
i think tom &apos;s gonna be there .
shut up .
tommy !
she gave you a drawer ?
it was a gesture of convenience .
and what did you put in it ?
- why do you care ?
- why do i care ?
do you know how spo@@ iled you are ?
i wish i had a girlfriend to say ,
&quot; hey , you want a drawer ? &quot;
i &apos;ll give you a drawer at my place .
i don &apos;t want a drawer in your place .
hey , it &apos;s me .
you okay ?
marshall told me your father shut you down .
i just needed to get out , cool down .
dad was right . like that &apos;s news .
i just wish there was more i could do .
we &apos;re working on cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ating el@@ sa &apos;s intel .
where are you ?
at the dru@@ g@@ store , picking up some pictures i had developed .
i think there &apos;s this great one of us .
you could hang it in your hallway by the co@@ a@@ track .
what ?
although some of the pictures might not come out because i used the wrong film speed .
next time , he said to keep in mind
i should use a slo@@ wer roll .
pen .
i &apos;ll probably be another 20 minutes .
i &apos;ll come over when i &apos;m done ?
bye .
what ?
she said she wanted to hang a picture next to the co@@ a@@ track .
so ?
she &apos;s never been to my place . i don &apos;t have a co@@ a@@ track .
maybe it was some kind of message .
what &apos;d she say exactly ?
she said , &quot; keep in mind i should use a slo@@ wer roll . &quot;
and ... this bag , please .
where &apos;s your bathroom ?
but i like it . i like this product .
- i &apos;ve used this one before .
- you have ?
i tried that once and broke out .
oh , really ?
thanks .
oh , my ... are you sig@@ ma ga@@ m@@ mas ?
i was president of my chapter in west virginia .
no way .
i swear to god !
president ?
you still have the exchange with the p@@ i de@@ lts ?
- yes , we do .
- you wanna come ?
- can i ? - absolutely .
i have been home@@ sick since i graduated .
thank you for invi@@ ting me !
wait , i got it .
she &apos;s using ski@@ p-@@ sequ@@ ence ci@@ pher@@ text .
take the first letter from every word and re@@ arrange them .
she &apos;s going to russia .
you wanted to see me ?
sydney knew i was listening to your phone conversation .
she also knew by the time i de@@ co@@ ded her an@@ a@@ gram , she &apos;d be halfway to russia .
i &apos;m gonna give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you had every intention of reporting that to me .
i &apos;m giving you this consider@@ ation because when sydney makes contact with you again , you &apos;re going to tell me exactly where she is .
if i &apos;d known what she was doing , i would have tried to stop her .
now that she &apos;s gone , there &apos;s nothing we can do to change her mind .
she &apos;s got 40 hours to find cap@@ lan .
why not give her backup ?
if it &apos;s not obvious to you by now , everything i do is in the service of protecting sydney .
for all we know , el@@ sa cap@@ lan &apos;s working with slo@@ ane .
for all we know , she was a con@@ spi@@ ra@@ tor in her husband &apos;s abdu@@ ction , which means sydney could be walking into a trap .
or she is about to save neil cap@@ lan &apos;s life .
this is not a debate .
just because you &apos;ve gotten comfortable with my daughter doesn &apos;t mean you should be comfortable with me .
if you don &apos;t report your next contact with sydney immediately ,
i will take action that you will regret .
okay , partner , let &apos;s get ready to ride .
hold up here . here you go !
get up ! get up ! you &apos;re no cowboy !
this is cowboy bar . speak english .
we have a mutual friend .
i don &apos;t care .
this is eigh@@ t-@@ seconds table .
everyone here has ri@@ dden bull for eight seconds .
goodbye .
oh , god .
something like that ?
something like that .
now , champion ... who is our mutual friend ?
el@@ sa cap@@ lan .
when exactly did you talk to el@@ sa ?
yesterday .
we are old friends .
el@@ sa &apos;s parents were in kho@@ lo@@ kov &apos;s class at the red ban@@ ner with my parents .
what do you need ?
i need a tracking device .
latest s v@@ r issue .
$ 50,000 cash .
u.s. bucks only .
deal .
open the door .
i want to see my son .
look , my family is all i care about .
your family ?
the one you manufac@@ tured in order to steal classified information ?
you don &apos;t know anything about me .
you couldn &apos;t be more wrong .
you &apos;re sydney &apos;s father .
i@@ rin@@ a dere@@ v@@ ko was your wife .
which makes me an expert on someone like you .
it started as a job .
a duty to your country .
that it required you to prostitu@@ te yourself was a small price to pay for serving the mother@@ land .
at first , everything went as planned .
then ... surely an accident ... you got pregnant .
you considered termin@@ ating the pregn@@ an@@ cy , but ... sel@@ fi@@ sh@@ ly , you didn &apos;t .
you hoped that becoming a mother would re@@ de@@ em you , would ab@@ solve your guilt .
- you &apos;re wrong !
- but you continued to lie and decei@@ ve both your husband and son .
i am not i@@ rin@@ a dere@@ v@@ ko !
i probably care more about your son than you do .
- that is not true .
- if i have my way ... you &apos;re never going to see your son again .
don &apos;t you dare take my son away from me !
don &apos;t you take my son away !
wei@@ ss .
wei@@ ss , it &apos;s me .
sorry to call you , but va@@ ugh@@ n &apos;s phone is probably t@@ apped .
is he there ?
guess who .
- sy@@ d ? - listen to me .
i &apos;ve got the tr@@ ack@@ er .
i in@@ put the codes el@@ sa gave us .
i found cap@@ lan in a building in sa@@ ria , spain .
it used to be a software company .
i &apos;m on my way now .
your father thinks you &apos;re walking into a trap .
i &apos;m not sure he &apos;s wrong .
i &apos;m supposed to convince you to come home .
i will , when i have cap@@ lan .
my father can &apos;t see straight when he looks at el@@ sa .
he only sees my mother .
and if this ends up being a mistake , so be it .
i believe her .
i &apos;m coming with you .
- i can &apos;t ask you to do that .
- you don &apos;t have to .
there &apos;s an alley in sa@@ ria behind the gan@@ dar@@ a hotel .
meet me there .
jack is gonna shoot you in the face .
give me a half-@@ hour head start .
tell him she called on your phone , and you gave it to me .
we only have 10 hours to find cap@@ lan .
if we end up sharing a cell in federal prison ,
i &apos;m not giving you a drawer .
okay , i got to go .
- i &apos;m gonna be late .
- you work for a travel magazine .
- tell them you &apos;re traveling .
- i wish i could .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s will , right ?
i &apos;ve seen you in the bri@@ e@@ fin@@ gs .
i &apos;m kind of new around here myself .
it &apos;s marshall f@@ lin@@ k@@ man .
_removed_
do they have you parking in the federal an@@ ne@@ x ?
&apos;cause i have to walk a half a mile to get here in the morning , and i &apos;m exhausted by the time ...
i shouldn &apos;t complain .
it &apos;s the only exercise i really get .
although i did see a gym .
excuse me .
i got ...
that &apos;s all right .
let &apos;s get some lunch or something .
the cia lunch .
hey , honey , you got a sec ?
yeah , yeah , yeah . what &apos;s up ?
are you near a computer ?
i was pulling up a recipe on my laptop , and it crashed . what ?
do you want me to pull up a recipe ?
- would you mind ? - sure .
what &apos;s the website ?
okay , what do you need ?
will you tell me what kind of fish they list ? hold on .
let me find it .
thank you for coming .
how much time do we have ?
12 minutes .
did you bring gear ?
did i bring gear ?
i spoke to wei@@ ss after we landed .
satellite &apos;s picked up five figures inside the building .
basement level , north wing .
slo@@ ane could be a block from here .
my mother .
if they are , they won &apos;t surrender to us .
i know .
what about the perimeter ?
no activity .
roof access will be our best bet .
not that i &apos;m a fan of you diso@@ be@@ ying the cia , but that was pretty good .
the way you got away .
thank you .
it &apos;s me .
i need you to do something else for me .
who are you , anyway ?
what are you ?
22 ?
_removed_
what are you doing working for a guy like slo@@ ane ?
what do you expect to get out of all of this ?
i was sent to school in england at a very young age .
out of nece@@ ssi@@ ty , one becomes self-@@ reli@@ ant and , perhaps , pre@@ ma@@ tu@@ rely ambi@@ tious .
i &apos;m like anyone , mr. cap@@ lan .
what i want is that which i never had .
you &apos;re gonna kill me , aren &apos;t you ?
you wouldn &apos;t share any of that stuff with me if you expected me to live .
i suggest you keep working .
i &apos;ll go around .
sy@@ d !
al@@ to !
is ar@@ vin slo@@ ane in this building ?
or i@@ rin@@ a dere@@ v@@ ko ?
no , no , no , no . but a blond guy just took off . - sar@@ k ?
- that &apos;s him , yeah .
i &apos;ll go after him .
what the hell &apos;s that for ?
you have to listen to what i &apos;m gonna say .
you won &apos;t want to believe me , but you have to , or you will die in less than 60 seconds .
what ?
freeze !
your wife , el@@ sa .
she works for russian intelligence .
i know .
six years ago , the n@@ sa recru@@ ited me .
they told me i was a target .
they had intel that i was gonna be appro@@ ached .
you &apos;re n@@ sa ?
they recru@@ ited me out of cal@@ tech , even though , if you ask them , they &apos;ll deny any af@@ fi@@ li@@ ation with me .
i knew el@@ sa was a spy the day we met .
your wife inje@@ cted you with a cy@@ ani@@ de cap@@ let .
we have to remove it now ! - what ?
- listen to me .
i came this far because of this .
- she wouldn &apos;t try and kill me .
- she didn &apos;t . her hand@@ lers did .
when did she imp@@ lant this thing ?
right after you met .
you have less than 30 seconds before you die .
we have to remove this right now .
give me your left wrist .
_removed_
no . i &apos;m okay .
- oh , god . come on .
- hang on .
hang on .
god !
thanks .
no matter what you may think of me ,
i would have done anything to bring you home .
i know .
we both have a lot to figure out .
i don &apos;t think either of us are in a position to pass any jud@@ g@@ ments .
i love you .
i love you , too .
i know i &apos;m not in a position to ask you for any fav@@ ors .
but whatever you plan on doing to me , just please leave va@@ ugh@@ n out of it .
va@@ ugh@@ n will be esc@@ or@@ ting the cap@@ l@@ ans to ba@@ in@@ bridge island .
i &apos;ve granted el@@ sa defe@@ ctor status .
she is not i@@ rin@@ a dere@@ v@@ ko .
we down@@ loaded the dna da@@ tab@@ a@@ se cap@@ lan de@@ cry@@ pted from the computer he was working on .
we finally have a lead on slo@@ ane and dere@@ v@@ ko .
good .
sydney , if you go around me again ,
i &apos;ll have you transferred .
and finding them will no longer be part of your job description .
i owe you an apology .
you don &apos;t have to explain .
let me say this .
when marcus first told me about sd-6 ,
i felt so betrayed .
in part , i bla@@ med you for that .
your world has these rules that force good people to lie , even to those they &apos;re closest to .
before i could accept that ,
i had to understand it .
i re@@ scin@@ ded the transfer order .
diane re@@ scin@@ ded the order .
mr. bri@@ sto@@ w . mr. bri@@ sto@@ w .
yes , marshall ?
i was doing some sp@@ el@@ un@@ king on the cia network .
m@@ apping it , really .
you can relax , because the dea@@ th-@@ star plans are not in the main computer .
anyway , i did find a ban@@ d@@ wi@@ d@@ th discre@@ pan@@ cy .
i thought it was a tro@@ jan virus imp@@ lan@@ ted on the system , but unless it was locked into a rena@@ ming ram ca@@ che ...
marshall !
please , english .
i found a massive information he@@ mor@@ r@@ ha@@ ge .
someone without authori@@ zation acce@@ ssed the system and down@@ loaded 10 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of satellite footage from tu@@ sc@@ any .
tu@@ sc@@ any ?
how did they hack in ?
they didn &apos;t . it came from this office .
no , there &apos;s no way the agency has season tickets for the la@@ kers .
i &apos;m telling you . 4 seats , 12 rows back .
by this point , i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m surprised , but i am .
i &apos;ll see you after i get the kids .
good night .
good night , diane .
- good night .
- good night .
feels good ... having it out in the open .
see you tomorrow .
oh ! by the way ...
diane ! oh , god !

africa . in the four years of making this series , we &apos;ve been to some ast@@ oni@@ shing places and seen animals be@@ having in ways that have never been fil@@ med before .
but africa has another story to tell .
the wild@@ life of this contin@@ ent has seen more changes in the last 50 years than it has in the last two million .
changing landsc@@ apes and changing cli@@ mate .
today &apos;s animals are facing un@@ preced@@ ented challen@@ ges .
whi@@ l@@ st around them , africa &apos;s human population is growing at nearly double the global rate .
there is an increa@@ sing ur@@ gency to understand and , cru@@ ci@@ ally , to con@@ serve the wild@@ life of this great contin@@ ent .
today , there is a new generation of na@@ tu@@ ra@@ lists and scientists who are fighting to save the wild places and the animals that live in them .
_removed_
this is the greatest wild@@ life contin@@ ent on the planet and what happens here is relevant to us all .
so what is the future of wild africa ?
this animal has become the world &apos;s nu@@ mber@@ -@@ one target for po@@ ach@@ ers .
its kind has been hun@@ ted almost to the point of extin@@ ction .
it &apos;s now so rare that this individual is watched over day and night .
this is the black r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os .
and black r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os are not@@ orious for being rather gru@@ mpy and suddenly char@@ ging .
but he is in great danger , because he has on his nose ...
.. that horn ...
.. which is worth its weight in gold .
the demand for r@@ hin@@ o horn has ro@@ cke@@ ted .
there has been a 3,000 % increase in po@@ aching just in the last five years .
_removed_
r@@ hin@@ os are a lu@@ cra@@ tive target for organi@@ sed crime . in chinese medicine , it &apos;s believed that r@@ hin@@ o horn can redu@@ ce fever and some viet@@ name@@ se sell it as a cure for everything , from cancer to han@@ go@@ vers . it &apos;s made of ker@@ at@@ in , the same sub@@ stance as hair and nail , and it has no clini@@ cally proven medi@@ cin@@ al value .
but it has made every black r@@ hin@@ o in africa a target . they &apos;ve all been killed in u@@ gan@@ da and r@@ wanda , and there are only around 600 left here in ken@@ ya .
but these are not po@@ ach@@ ers .
these are prote@@ ctors .
and that protection is over@@ seen by r@@ hin@@ o expert dr matthew mu@@ tin@@ da , one of the ken@@ ya wild@@ life services &apos; top ve@@ ts .
&apos;@@ black r@@ hin@@ os are cri@@ tically en@@ dan@@ ge@@ red . &apos;
that is what here , at le@@ wa wild@@ life con@@ servan@@ cy , we &apos;re trying to do save the animal , provide a safe and secure san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary where the animal can bre@@ ed and live free@@ ly .
there aren &apos;t many true wild r@@ hin@@ os left in africa . most , like these , in le@@ wa wild@@ life con@@ servan@@ cy , are under armed guard .
this young female has reached the age when matthew must do some health checks , including taking blood samples . this will help de@@ ter po@@ ach@@ ers and traffi@@ ckers , as dna in il@@ legally tra@@ ded r@@ hin@@ o horn can be tracked back to its ori@@ gin .
if you have to do an@@ a@@ es@@ the@@ sia in the wild , you will expect some degree of risk .
this female has re@@ acted badly to the an@@ a@@ es@@ thetic .
she &apos;s not breathing .
it &apos;s a rare and extremely serious situation .
he knows that the next few minutes are cru@@ cial . and when an animal is this big , there &apos;s only one way to get the heart going again when you &apos;re out in the bush .
thanks to matthew &apos;s quick thinking , they can hear that she is breathing again .
they &apos;ve got to get her back on her feet .
_removed_
mission accompli@@ shed . it &apos;s been an or@@ deal , but now , this r@@ hin@@ o can be tracked and protected for the rest of her life .
within minutes , she &apos;s gra@@ zing peace@@ fully again with her mother . it may seem hear@@ tless to treat an animal like that , but we have to keep tab@@ s on them and be able to identify individu@@ als .
they &apos;re in great danger . even now , on average , one r@@ hin@@ o is killed by po@@ ach@@ ers every day in africa .
there are so few black r@@ hin@@ o left in ken@@ ya that we &apos;re getting to know each individual .
but this is still a creature that can surprise us .
previously , it was wi@@ de@@ ly believed that black r@@ hin@@ os were lar@@ ge@@ ly soli@@ tary creatures .
here , in the kal@@ a@@ har@@ i , a star@@ light camera revea@@ ls that they may be much more soci@@ able than many thought .
this water@@ -@@ hole gathering is an en@@ chan@@ ting window into the past .
early explo@@ rers reported seeing a r@@ hin@@ o behind every bush . before the inven@@ tion of the gun , there were probably hundreds of thousands of r@@ hin@@ os across the contin@@ ent .
the people protecting r@@ hin@@ os in africa are stri@@ ving to ensure that we &apos;ll still be able to witness wonderful scenes like this in 50 years &apos; time .
_removed_
the human population of the contin@@ ent has just exce@@ eded one billion and many wild animals are being hun@@ ted commer@@ ci@@ ally for food .
some , legally , but many , il@@ legally .
wild@@ life meat is often sold as goat or beef .
the amount is ast@@ oni@@ shing .
millions of ton@@ nes are eaten across africa every year .
_removed_
but commercial hunting is not just affe@@ cting the gra@@ z@@ ers .
as the prey de@@ crea@@ ses , it &apos;s affe@@ cting the preda@@ tors too . 50 years ago , there were about half a million li@@ ons in africa .
today , there are less than 3@@ 0,000 . but in one particular part of africa , things are impro@@ ving in a quite extraordinary way .
these hun@@ ters have become part of a new and un@@ likely alliance . in recent years , hungry li@@ ons have increa@@ sin@@ gly been killing li@@ ve@@ stock .
one group of traditional ma@@ a@@ sa@@ i have re@@ acted in a very un@@ traditional way .
the ma@@ a@@ sa@@ i are ca@@ ttle her@@ ders who don &apos;t eat wild animals .
_removed_
ma@@ a@@ sa@@ i and li@@ ons are ancient adver@@ sa@@ ries .
a lion hunt is still a ri@@ te of passage for young ma@@ a@@ sa@@ i warriors like o@@ lu@@ bi la@@ i@@ ru@@ m@@ be .
for me and any ma@@ a@@ sa@@ i , killing a lion is the ultimate ful@@ fil@@ ment of a truly accompli@@ shed ma@@ a@@ sa@@ i .
nothing compa@@ res to that .
there is nobody who knows more about living al@@ ong@@ side li@@ ons than the ma@@ a@@ sa@@ i themselves .
i met o@@ lu@@ bi and some of the other warriors in his village to find out about their relationship with the local pride .
how many li@@ ons are there around here ?
_removed_
so they all have names ?
every single lion has a name .
a ma@@ a@@ sa@@ i name . and when you see a lion , do you know how it &apos;s going to behave ?
it depends on the lion .
_removed_
_removed_
only if you threaten it .
mmm , well , i hope the next lion knows that . o@@ lu@@ bi killed his first lion when he was just 17 , after it attacked his ca@@ ttle .
_removed_
and that led to a remarkable tur@@ n@@ around .
the ma@@ a@@ sa@@ i respect all living things .
and i began to feel guilty about the lion that i had killed .

o@@ lu@@ bi had a dramatic change of heart .
he turned his back on hundreds of years of ma@@ a@@ sa@@ i tradition .

instead of hunting li@@ ons , o@@ lu@@ bi will be protecting them . he tea@@ med up with ste@@ phan@@ ie dol@@ ren@@ ry , who helped pi@@ one@@ er the project .
just by respe@@ cting their tradi@@ tions and also bringing in their e@@ co@@ logical knowledge , it &apos;s been hu@@ ge@@ ly successful .
they know their areas , they know how to track li@@ ons , they &apos;ve been doing it for generation after generation . they know how to track them , they know how to hunt them , they know how to find them .
this is only a sma@@ ll-@@ scale project .
but with lion numbers as low as they are , they need all the help they can get .

no li@@ ons have been killed in the immediate area since the project began .
by com@@ b@@ ining the science , both ancient and con@@ temporary , they &apos;re beginning to make a real difference .
there &apos;s so much to be learned .

and , in return , they teach us about the environment and how things have changed in their environment .
and it &apos;s a really neat exchange .
you can &apos;t say we &apos;re the bio@@ logi@@ sts or the teachers .

we &apos;re both teachers and we &apos;re both students and i think that &apos;s ...

cri@@ tically , at the heart of this project is a huge attitude change by these ma@@ a@@ sa@@ i warriors .

the sche@@ me is a huge success .
there are about 100 li@@ ons involved in the sche@@ me in this neigh@@ bour@@ hood .
this is 2@@ 1@@ st-@@ century con@@ servation in action .
perhaps the biggest threat to wild@@ life is the competition for space with the rap@@ i@@ d@@ ly-@@ growing human population .
the rich volcan@@ ic so@@ ils are extremely fer@@ tile .
it &apos;s one of the most inten@@ si@@ vely cul@@ ti@@ vated areas in africa .
but the farmers also share this region with one of our closest relatives .
this is home to the last 8@@ 00@@ -@@ or@@ -so wild mountain gori@@ llas left on earth .
we know a great deal about these animals , they &apos;ve been closely studied for 50 years .
one strong sil@@ ver@@ back male keeps everyone in order .
and gori@@ lla family life is mostly peaceful . until a few generations ago , mountain gori@@ llas , hidden in the se@@ clu@@ sion of their fore@@ sts were sel@@ dom seen by human beings .
but their habi@@ t@@ at was stea@@ di@@ ly being car@@ ved away , and now these gori@@ llas are ma@@ ro@@ oned on the volcan@@ ic slo@@ pes in a sea of far@@ m@@ land .
the fact that gori@@ llas now regu@@ larly come into contact with people not only means an increa@@ sed threat of po@@ aching , but also of disease .
gori@@ llas have little or no resistance to the bugs that we carry .
numbers here once dropped to around 2@@ 50 .
they were facing extin@@ ction .
action had to be taken . the boun@@ da@@ ries of the national park were strictly en@@ forced , hal@@ ting the en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ment of far@@ m@@ land .
and it was decided that the only solution was to inten@@ si@@ vely manage the remaining gori@@ llas .
teams of scientists constantly monitor them .
their fore@@ sts are patro@@ lled to cut po@@ ach@@ ers &apos; sna@@ res .
and ve@@ ts watch their health closely .
_removed_
this is fun@@ ded mostly through e@@ co-@@ touri@@ sm and don@@ ations from all over the world .
mountain gori@@ llas are now back from the brin@@ k . this level of human interven@@ tion might not be ideal , but it &apos;s working .
_removed_
inten@@ sive management within a protected area may represent the only future for many african species .
_removed_
what happens if the animal you &apos;re trying to protect is not sui@@ ted to park life ?
elephan@@ ts require vast am@@ oun@@ ts of space to ro@@ am .
_removed_
given the chance , they will even move between countries in search of the best food .
_removed_
this was the scene in a@@ mb@@ os@@ eli national park in 200@@ 9 .
_removed_
and this was the worst dr@@ ought for half a century .
60 % of ze@@ bra@@ s and 9@@ 5 % of wil@@ de@@ bee@@ sts were wiped out .
the sea@@ son@@ al ra@@ ins had failed for the last two years .
and the elephan@@ ts that lived here were slowly starving .
the park created to protect them is now surrounded by far@@ m@@ land .
the elephan@@ ts had little choice of where else to go .
_removed_
they are the front line for elephant protection in the park .
and they know these animals better than anyone else .
nora n@@ ji@@ rain@@ i and ka@@ ti@@ to and so@@ ila sa@@ yi@@ al@@ el .
_removed_
they are family to us .
hello , an@@ a@@ sta@@ sia ! the sisters have been following these elephan@@ ts for over 25 years , trying to ensure their safety , particularly at times when life is tough for these animals .
it really was terrible .
there was nothing actually to feed on .
i even went and asked the old ma@@ a@@ sa@@ i men whether they have ever experienced such a dr@@ ought .
_removed_
in 200@@ 9 ... .. we lost quite a number of elephan@@ ts .
i think we lost about 400 elephan@@ ts .
and it started with the young ones .
elephan@@ ts usually escape dr@@ ought by moving into other less affected areas .
but africa &apos;s human population is growing at double the global rate .
and traditional migra@@ tion rou@@ tes have been cut by the development of to@@ wns , cities , far@@ m@@ land and roads , leaving these elephan@@ ts stuck .
this young cal@@ f is starving ... .. and there is nothing they can do to help .
for the sisters , who know each elephant personally , this is a terrible moment .
it is something that we feel in our hearts .
you can imagine the kind of feelings that we get .
you know , knowing those elephan@@ ts and seeing something like that happen .
it really touches us .
it was a tough year for all the young elephan@@ ts in the region .
we lost all the cal@@ ves that were born that year .
_removed_
there was nothing the sisters could do to save the baby . but they were determined to save any elephan@@ ts they could , especially mothers who could bre@@ ed again . they found this female stuck in the mud , exhausted in a dri@@ ed@@ -up lake bed .
the elephant that got stuck in the mud was ko@@ li@@ da .
_removed_
she was there for quite a long time .
a ma@@ a@@ sa@@ i reported it to us and we had to com@@ b@@ ine efforts with the ken@@ ya wild@@ life services people .
weigh@@ ing about three ton@@ nes , ko@@ li@@ da is just too heavy to shift by hand .
she is wea@@ k@@ ening fast .
so the next morning , heavy machin@@ ery is brought in . after two days stuck in the mud , ko@@ li@@ da is exhausted , but she &apos;s up on her feet again .
the ra@@ ins did return to a@@ mb@@ os@@ eli . and thanks in part to the work of those dedicated three women , elephant numbers are now beginning to rise again .
there &apos;s no doubt that this was an extremely severe event .
but is it an isolated incident or a develo@@ ping pattern ? they say that with global warming , we actually don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
but we just have to cross fingers and hope for a better future . given the opportunity , the numbers of elephan@@ ts in east africa will recover .
especially , if they &apos;re given the freedom to range wi@@ de@@ ly and so avoid the har@@ she@@ st conditions .
one solution to help elephan@@ ts find the space they need is to link par@@ ks together and provide safe rou@@ tes between them .
elephan@@ ts are great trave@@ llers and here , in this part of ken@@ ya , they regu@@ larly moved from the low@@ lands up the side of the mountains to feed in the fore@@ sts up there .
but then , the human population of ken@@ ya grew and roads like this one were constru@@ cted , pen@@ ning the elephan@@ ts down in the low@@ land , where they created ha@@ vo@@ c amongst the far@@ ms .
_removed_
and then someone suggested building an under@@ pass . within 24 hours of it being completed , one elephant had passed through .
_removed_
simple ideas like this under@@ pass are a life@@ line for these elephan@@ ts , especially in times of dr@@ ought .
africa &apos;s cli@@ mate is certainly changing .
some parts of the contin@@ ent have become 3@@ .@@ 5 degrees cen@@ ti@@ grade ho@@ tter in the past 20 years .
at the summ@@ it of africa &apos;s most famous mountain , ki@@ li@@ man@@ j@@ ar@@ o , 80 % of its permanent ice fields have disappeared .
_removed_
all over africa , the moun@@ tain@@ ous regi@@ ons are often the first indi@@ ca@@ tors of cli@@ mate change .
here , in the ethi@@ op@@ ian high@@ lands live very un@@ usu@@ al-@@ looking creatures .
ge@@ la@@ da bab@@ o@@ ons .
cli@@ mate change refugees . although this region of ethi@@ op@@ ia lies in the tro@@ pic@@ s , up at 4@@ ,000 me@@ tres , it doesn &apos;t feel like it . unlike most african animals , ge@@ la@@ das are adap@@ ted to life in the cold .
_removed_
now , there is only one . with the warming cli@@ mate , their gra@@ zing is becoming more and more scar@@ ce , restri@@ cted to co@@ ol@@ er and higher places .
these ge@@ la@@ das are being forced higher into the mountains .
_removed_
this is a species living on the edge . even though they &apos;re isolated on the mountain tops , they &apos;re not imm@@ une to our influence . as a result of changing cli@@ mate , these ge@@ la@@ da bab@@ o@@ ons may soon be gone from our planet .
africa is the world &apos;s ho@@ tt@@ est contin@@ ent .
and there is no doubt it &apos;s getting war@@ mer .
the sa@@ hara is the largest hot desert in the world .
very little can survive in these harsh conditions . along the desert edge , life cl@@ ings on in the face of en@@ cro@@ aching san@@ ds .
but for how long ? al@@ ong@@ side the wild@@ life , 22 million people struggle to make a living on these desert mar@@ gin@@ s .
can anything be done to stop the sand overwhel@@ ming this fra@@ gi@@ le land ?
one idea is to build a green wall of trees across 11 countries .
the project has already started in sen@@ e@@ gal .
_removed_
getting 11 countries to work together is not easy and simply irri@@ ga@@ ting a 5@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ mile long belt of trees is an ambi@@ tious task .
but all over africa , people are recogni@@ sing how important it is to have trees as part of their local landsc@@ ape .
this group of volunte@@ ers has planted nearly 100 million s@@ ap@@ lings .
they are just one of coun@@ tless similar groups and individu@@ als taking it upon themselves to re@@ forest their own part of this great contin@@ ent .
trees are essential for the future of the contin@@ ent and indeed , to the rest of the planet .
this is the con@@ go ba@@ sin .
it &apos;s one of the most bio@@ logi@@ cally important fore@@ sts on earth and it &apos;s not just because of the concentra@@ tion of plants and animals that live here .
it &apos;s because it &apos;s also one of the power@@ houses behind the planet &apos;s wind and rain .
each he@@ ct@@ are of trees relea@@ ses , as v@@ ap@@ our , almost 19@@ 0,000 li@@ tres of water a year .
this water passes into the atmosphere to be transpor@@ ted around the entire glo@@ be .
that means the heart of the world &apos;s weather lies in tro@@ pi@@ cal fore@@ sts .
unfortunately , there &apos;s an almost in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able demand in europe and china for hard@@ wood from these very fore@@ sts .
and that is having an enormous impact . as more tro@@ pi@@ cal forest is fe@@ lled , some scientists are seeing a cor@@ rela@@ tion with changing storm patter@@ ns across europe and america .
and it &apos;s likely to become more extreme .
sta@@ g@@ ger@@ ingly , 50 % of the con@@ go ba@@ sin forest has been allo@@ cated for lo@@ gging .
the future of africa &apos;s forest has never been more critical for us all .
but the consequences of global warming aren &apos;t limited to the land .
africa is almost completely surrounded by oce@@ ans .
here on the east coast , there are animals feeling the changing cli@@ mate in a most surpri@@ sing way .
this is a young female green turtle .
during her lifetime , she will travel thousands of miles through the ocean looking for food .
tur@@ tles return to the same beach from which they ha@@ tched to lay their own eggs .
the eggs are buried in the sand and the ha@@ tch@@ lings will emer@@ ge after about two months .
but there &apos;s a strange thing about turtle eggs .
and that is the temperature at which the eggs are kept will determine the sex of most of the ha@@ tch@@ lings .
if the sand temperature is high , they will be female , if it &apos;s low , they will be male .
global warming could have a cru@@ cial effect on turtle popu@@ lations .
and this young female may find it very difficult in years to come to find a male with which to mate .
but a local con@@ servation group recogni@@ sed that the odds are st@@ acking up against these little tur@@ tles .
there &apos;s not much they can do about cli@@ mate change , but they have got together with the local fi@@ sher@@ men to try and improve the tur@@ tles &apos; chances of survival .
every turtle counts . so , each time one is found injured or accidentally caught in the ne@@ ts , it &apos;s brought to ka@@ hin@@ di chan@@ ga@@ wa and his team .
so we began with only 16 fi@@ sher@@ men al@@ together in 199@@ 8 .
now we have hundreds of fi@@ sher@@ men working with us .
gra@@ zing by tur@@ tles is essential for the health of the beds of sea@@ grass and these are the home of shri@@ mps and lob@@ sters and that , of course , helps fi@@ sher@@ men too .
the project has a turtle re@@ habi@@ li@@ tation centre and for the last two years , it &apos;s become home to she@@ lla .
she had an accident with a boat .
_removed_
she lost three ri@@ bs and her sp@@ ine was damaged .
it &apos;s now in the process of hea@@ ling back together .
she@@ lla &apos;s injuries have affected her bu@@ o@@ yan@@ cy .
she &apos;s hea@@ led well and to en@@ courage her to exercise her fli@@ ppers properly , she has , every day , a little trip to the sea@@ side . we usually take she@@ lla for a sea bath on a daily basis , and the reason for doing that is to give her enough room to get exerci@@ ses .
she gets an opportunity to eat her natural food . we believe it keeps her fit and the other thing is , she gets to use her rear fli@@ ppers quite often .
_removed_
it &apos;s really enjo@@ y@@ able .
very few people have the privile@@ ge like i do of swimming with the tur@@ tles and having that fun .
i do enjoy what i &apos;m doing .
she@@ lla certainly did get stronger , but the hope that some day she might swim out in the open was not to be ful@@ filled .
_removed_
this kind of work will in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably have set@@ backs .
but there are always new tur@@ tles to be cared for .
_removed_
_removed_
like these ones here .
_removed_
otherwise the turtle &apos;s healthy .
shall we have a go ?
since 199@@ 8 till now , we &apos;ve released over 8@@ ,@@ 200 tur@@ tles . it makes me feel proud and privile@@ ged , we &apos;ve done lots of work with the community and changing the at@@ titu@@ des and their behavi@@ ours .
i guess our job as an organi@@ sation was really successful .
a young turtle like that could lay 6@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ 7@@ ,000 eggs in her lifetime .

saving just one individual requires huge effort and of course , saving a species requires even more .
but these hero@@ ic efforts are only ever going to be a parti@@ al solution .
every individual animal is part of a much bigger story , part of an inter@@ connected web of plants , animals and the landsc@@ ape itself that make up an entire e@@ cos@@ y@@ ste@@ m .
saving e@@ cos@@ y@@ ste@@ ms is the key to africa &apos;s wild future .
gor@@ on@@ gos@@ a in mo@@ z@@ ambi@@ que is a modern day ju@@ ra@@ ssi@@ c park .
it &apos;s ruled by some of the world &apos;s biggest cro@@ co@@ di@@ les .
some of these monsters are six me@@ tres long and close to 50 years old .
somehow they managed to escape a civil war la@@ sting nearly 20 years , which swe@@ pt through gor@@ on@@ gos@@ a .
9@@ 5 % of all the other large animals were wiped out .
_removed_
this was a thri@@ ving touri@@ st attrac@@ tion .
a wild paradise . visitors flo@@ cked from around the world , drawn by the vast range and a@@ bun@@ dance of the wild@@ life . the most popular spot for touri@@ sts was an old restaurant , a look@@ -out post for the local li@@ ons .
the restaurant has long gone .
along with the li@@ ons .
gor@@ on@@ gos@@ a looked empty and beyond rescue .
but not to everyone .
a brave and ambi@@ tious project began to try and re@@ store the park to its former rich@@ ness and splen@@ d@@ our .
the first stage is to find out which animals as well as cro@@ co@@ di@@ les are still here .
so the team is m@@ apping and counting all the big animals they see in the park .
but it soon became clear that these big animals were only part of the story .
perhaps even more important might be the little ones hidden under@@ foot .
it &apos;s understanding these creatures that is attrac@@ ting some of the best minds in the scientific world .

they &apos;re what i like to call the little things that run the earth .
it &apos;s the rich diver@@ sity of inse@@ ct life here that gives gor@@ on@@ gos@@ a the prospe@@ ct of a future .
these creatures form the basis of life in the park .
this is so much fun .
the creatures that do most of the work , turn most of the energy , save most of the material and allow us to re@@ in@@ ser@@ t big animals with some confidence .
have you got it in the vi@@ al yet ?
_removed_
professor wilson was one of the first scientists to explore this area together with local wild@@ life bio@@ logist ton@@ ga tor@@ tu@@ da .
if you could gather them all up , all these little in@@ ver@@ te@@ bra@@ te creatures , and wei@@ gh them , they would wei@@ gh far more than all of the big animals put together , even in a fully re@@ stored park . it &apos;s these little creatures , together with the plants and trees , that still make this place a vi@@ able option for re@@ introdu@@ cing bigger animals .
i can &apos;t be sure that &apos;s a new species , but this is the kind of thing that might be .
this park came that close to vani@@ shing ... .. and i &apos;m happy to report it is coming back .
and this is one of the great stories .
it &apos;s inspi@@ rational , i think . it &apos;s a fine , shining example of what to do with all our par@@ ks , even those that have been damaged by human activity .
but there &apos;s another reason why gor@@ on@@ gos@@ a is important for the future of africa and perhaps for us all .
it is here , in this park , that people come to see , not just the big animals that thri@@ ll us , but they will see earth as it looked and felt before the coming of humanity .
saving big animals is important , but to do that with any real success , we have to start understanding and pre@@ serving the plants and inse@@ cts that support an e@@ cos@@ y@@ ste@@ m .
it &apos;s this that will allow the larger animals to thri@@ ve .
gor@@ on@@ gos@@ a is a real success story .
_removed_
while it can never be exactly the same as it was before the war , it can still become a rich and thri@@ ving e@@ cos@@ y@@ ste@@ m .
the scale of the challenge across africa is enormous .
after all , it &apos;s a huge contin@@ ent . the united kingdom , china , the united states of america , india ,
japan and most of the rest of europe would all fit within its bor@@ ders .
africa still re@@ tains 45 % of the earth &apos;s un@@ cul@@ ti@@ vated land .
it &apos;s still the greatest wil@@ derness on earth and that is why it &apos;s important .
human beings have lived al@@ ong@@ side wild@@ life here longer than anywhere else .
but now in the 2@@ 1st century , animal numbers are at a critical level .
_removed_
that means taking care of the animals and lands where they live , so there is still space for us all to co@@ exist .
nobody knows what the future has in store for this little cal@@ f . or indeed , how the changes that in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably are going to take place in africa will affect the rest of the world and this little animal .
but one thing is certain .
what happens here is more important than it has ever been and that the relationship of the rest of the world to this great contin@@ ent and the creatures that live in it is more important than ever before .
on whi@@ che@@ ver part of the planet we live , we all have a part to play in what sort of future this wild contin@@ ent has .
_removed_

i &apos;m flying over the great ri@@ ft valley in east africa .
but perhaps the most ambi@@ tious task for this shoot is the filming with black r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os .
they have a reputation for being aggressive and with poor eye@@ sight , they &apos;re likely to charge obje@@ cts or people they don &apos;t recogni@@ se .
but the p@@ light of the r@@ hin@@ o is such an important story that we want to get as close to them as possible .
we also want to meet the people who are working to protect them .
so our team have come to asse@@ ss the vi@@ ability of filming up close with a r@@ hin@@ o called elvis who &apos;s been rea@@ red by humans .
he should be safer than a wild r@@ hin@@ o , but there &apos;s still a risk he could be un@@ predictable with strangers .
wild@@ life ran@@ ger , ton@@ ga ka@@ se@@ yo has brought up elvis by hand and knows that ti@@ ck@@ ling him gently with a stick keeps him calm .
but if anything were to go seriously wrong , there would be little he could do against a one-@@ ton@@ ne elvis .
and this fact hasn &apos;t escaped camer@@ a@@ man mike fox .
_removed_
_removed_
if he decided to bat us all into the next world ... he would do .
director kate broo@@ me checks with ton@@ ga that it &apos;s safe for the crew to get closer .
normally , we have to stay in the land ro@@ vers . they &apos;re saying it &apos;s ok to go in . this is such an extraordinary opportunity , to be this close to ... a black r@@ hin@@ o .
the trial goes well with elvis and the stage is set for future filming .
several weeks later , the team are back and this time i &apos;ve joined them .
but elvis &apos;s mood has changed .
he seems more wil@@ ful . &apos; now , i &apos;ve stood by many wild animals in my time , &apos; but i &apos;m not as fast on my p@@ ins as i used to be . &apos; &apos; we don &apos;t want to test elvis &apos;s patience , so we get on with filming . &apos;
a horn that is worth its weight in gold .
and one way ... .. of protecting him ...
.. would be ... to cut that horn off the nose .
how is it ?
_removed_
&apos;@@ the team check that they have what they need &apos; and elvis lets us know that he &apos;s had enough . &apos;
_removed_
_removed_
&apos;@@ but actually , it &apos;s a positive sign &apos; that elvis is not as friendly this time .
&apos;@@ ton@@ ga and his colleagues want elvis to live more like a wild r@@ hin@@ o &apos; and develop a wa@@ rin@@ ess of humans &apos; that may offer him some protection from po@@ ach@@ ers . &apos;
good luck to you , elvis . whi@@ l@@ st filming , we &apos;re lucky enough to have a very well equi@@ pped camp .
it &apos;s in the bush and there &apos;s no esc@@ aping the wild animals .
one of the great , wonderful things about camp@@ ing out in the middle of the open is the animals .
but it can also be one of the dangerous / annoying things .
absolutely . in the annoying cate@@ g@@ ory , ver@@ vet mon@@ keys .
ver@@ vet mon@@ keys have stolen my fer@@ re@@ ro ro@@ cher and one of my g@@ low sticks from our medical supplies .
i &apos;ll identify the naughty one that &apos;s been stealing our stuff .
and they leave little presents for us when they &apos;ve been in , just as a calling card .
but camp manager and@@ res finds more worrying animal signs .
_removed_
some must have come in and i don &apos;t know ...
you can see a few scra@@ tches .
i think maybe he was wanting to look at himself in the mirror . &apos; li@@ ons in camp are worrying enough , &apos; but there i was reading my book when ... &apos;
whoa ! &apos; .. a cap@@ e buff@@ alo arrives . &apos;
&apos;@@ the most gru@@ mpy and dangerous of the big five african animals . &apos;
mike ! stay in your tent .
shall we get david to get in the tent ? buff@@ alo usually move in her@@ ds , so there &apos;s something odd about him .
it may be that it was brought up as a cal@@ f and is humani@@ sed .
or it may be that he &apos;s an out@@ cast from the her@@ d in some way and that he &apos;s rather gru@@ mpy and fed up with life .
but i think it &apos;s just hot and he &apos;s just plo@@ dding around and wondering where he might get a drink and a decent sandwich .
_removed_
the team &apos;s filming has coinci@@ ded with the ne@@ west arrival at le@@ wa , a baby r@@ hin@@ o in need of 2@@ 4-@@ hour care .
this little cha@@ p was born blind and is gui@@ ded everywhere by his kee@@ pers .
they took him away from his mother a few weeks ago , because she couldn &apos;t protect him any more .
he &apos;s very vulnerable so he would have been killed by preda@@ tors .
it &apos;s like filling up a petro@@ l tank .
&apos;@@ every r@@ hin@@ o is precious &apos; and so it seems a fitting end for the final scene of the series . &apos;
no-one knows what the future holds for this little creature , nor indeed what changes will take place on the great contin@@ ent on which he lives .

with more on this tragic
details are still ske@@ tchy at this point , harry .
however , anonymous official has heard rumor that 1.@@ 4 of the dead are indeed children .
the mayor &apos;s office has released no actual details at this time .
however , a highly placed authority has imp@@ lied the identity of the killer to be known :
the name &apos; brick bar@@ do &apos; was over@@ heard .
brick bar@@ do is a detective that was involved in the fi@@ ll@@ more incident earlier this year .

good night .
i had a wife and two kids .
baby girl a boy about kevin &apos;s age .
someone who wanted to hurt me , did it by hurting them .
kevin &apos;s father is dead , too .
he was shot , holding up a liquor store , years ago .
kevin doesn &apos;t even remember him .
he was a gang@@ ban@@ ger , brooklyn home@@ boy .
and at the time i thought home@@ boy was as cool as you can get .
and then when kevin was born , he swore he was done with gan@@ gs , done with crime . but ... he lied .
i don &apos;t know , it &apos;s like in this neighborhood gan@@ gs are the only way you can be noticed , the only way you can be somebody .
and they give you a new name , and then you are shor@@ ty , or slee@@ py , or psycho ...
gan@@ gs give you an identity .
i didn &apos;t know how hard it is keeping kevin away ... his friends already belonged ...
was trying then i &apos;m gonna lose him if i don &apos;t do something about it .
so why didn &apos;t you leave ?
where ... would i go ?
i don &apos;t have any money , i can &apos;t even pay the rent .
dropped out of school to have kevin .
besides , this is my home .
this is where i grew up , everything i &apos;ve ever known is here . i &apos;m not gonna run away .
you &apos;ve got a lot of gu@@ t@@ s. lady .
but maybe you &apos;re using the wrong approach .
what do you mean ?
fight fire with fire .
i always thought you fight fire with water ?
some fires are too big .
kevin , leave him alone .
ke@@ v , get it and gear , you &apos;re late .
have a good day at school . be careful .
i love you .
bye .
oh , hi .
here is my number at work , in case you need to call .
i don &apos;t think going to work is such a great idea , if those pun@@ ks are looking for you .
well , if i don &apos;t go to work , i don &apos;t get paid .
if i don &apos;t get paid , i can &apos;t pay the rent .
and there is nothing to eat , so ...
i &apos;m going to work .
i think you should stay in , though .
the world isn &apos;t safe for someone your size .
- look , lady , i &apos;m gonna find the rest of these pun@@ ks and finish this .
- kevin will be home around 3@@ .@@ 30 .
got to do what i got to do , lady .
be careful out there , de@@ bi .

i hope he didn &apos;t go home .

what &apos;s it say there ?
_removed_
well , it , um says several things here .
said you &apos;ve been be@@ lli@@ ge@@ rent talked when un@@ authorized you &apos;ve been re@@ sen@@ t@@ ful in attitude toward work in general , that you &apos;re lazy .
che@@ wing gum in class .
the real reason you &apos;ve been sent over here is because they wanted you to be evalu@@ ated .
- to determine whether or not you &apos;re men@@ tally ill .
why do you think they might think that ?
well , as near as i can figure out , it &apos;s because i , uh .... uh , fight and fuck too much .
in the pen@@ i@@ ten@@ ti@@ ary ?
no , no , no , you mean why ...
wait ... why did you get sent over here from the work farm ?
oh . oh , yeah . oh .
uh .... well , i really don &apos;t know , doc .
it says here that you went around ...
- let me just take a look .
_removed_
- you &apos;ve got at least five arre@@ sts for assault . - yeah . - what can you tell me about that ?
- five fights , huh ? rocky mar@@ ci@@ ano &apos;s got 40 , and he &apos;s a milli@@ onaire .
- that &apos;s true .
of course , it &apos;s true that you went in for statu@@ tory rape . that &apos;s true , is it not , this time ?

- mm . mm . but , uh , between you and me , uh she might have been 15 .
when you get that little red bea@@ ver right up there in front of you , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s crazy at all .
- and i don &apos;t think you do either . - i hear what you &apos;re saying . no man alive could resist that .
that &apos;s why i got into jail to begin with .
now they &apos;re telling me i &apos;m crazy over here because i don &apos;t sit there like a goddamn vege@@ table . it don &apos;t make a bit of sense to me .
if that &apos;s what being crazy is then i &apos;m sen@@ se@@ less , out of it , gone down the road , wa@@ ck@@ o .
_removed_
well , to be honest with you , mc@@ murphy , what it says here is that they think ....

- do i look like that kind of guy to you , doc ?
well .... let &apos;s just be frank for a minute , ran@@ d@@ all , if you would .
tell me do you think there &apos;s anything wrong with your mind , really ?

mr. ell@@ s@@ worth you &apos;ll wear yourself out . come here .
all right , gentlemen , let &apos;s begin .
at the close of friday &apos;s meeting we were discu@@ ssing mr. har@@ ding &apos;s problem concer@@ ning his wife .
mr. har@@ ding stated that his wife made him un@@ easy because she drew sta@@ res from men on the street .
- is that correct , mr. har@@ ding ?
uh , yes .
he also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere , but he wasn &apos;t able to say how .
mr. har@@ ding has been heard to say to his wife :
&quot; i hate you . i don &apos;t ever want to see you again .
so does anyone care to touch on this further ?
mr. scan@@ lon , would you begin today ?
are you sure ?
billy , how about you ?
no ... no ... no , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;d like to write in my book that you began the meeting .
just once .
mr. martin@@ i ?
are you with us ?
yes .
would you like to begin ?
mr. che@@ swi@@ ck ?
- me ?
you mean there &apos;s not a man here who has an opinion on this matter ?
all right . mr. har@@ ding you &apos;ve stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men .
oh , yes . yes , very much ... i suspect her .
i suspect her . well , maybe you can tell us why you suspect her .
well , i can only spe@@ cu@@ late as to the reasons why .
have you ever spe@@ cu@@ lated , mr. har@@ ding that perhaps you are imp@@ ati@@ ent with your wife because she doesn &apos;t meet your mental requi@@ re@@ ments ?
perhaps , but you see , the only thing i can really spe@@ cu@@ late on , nurse ra@@ tched is the very existence of my life , with or without my wife in terms of the human relationships , the ju@@ x@@ t@@ apos@@ i@@ tion of one person to another , the form , the content .
har@@ ding , why don &apos;t you knock off the bullshit and get to the point ?
this is the point .
this is the point , tab@@ er . it &apos;s not bullshit .
i &apos;m not just talking about my wife , i &apos;m talking about my life .
i can &apos;t seem to get that through to you .
i &apos;m not just talking about one person , i &apos;m talking about everybody . i &apos;m talking about form . i &apos;m talking about content .
i &apos;m talking about inter@@ relationships .
i &apos;m talking about god , the devil , hell , heaven .
- do you understand ?
finally ? - ha ! yeah , har@@ ding , you &apos;re so fucking dumb i can &apos;t believe it .
it makes me feel very pe@@ cu@@ liar , very pe@@ cu@@ liar ...

that music is for everyone , mr. mc@@ murphy .

what you probably don &apos;t realize is that we have a lot of old men on this ward who couldn &apos;t hear the music if we turned it lower .
that music is all they have . your hand is sta@@ ining my window .
i &apos;m sorry , ma &apos;am .
really sorry .
- mr. mc@@ murphy , your medication .

well , that &apos;s very good , mr. mc@@ murphy .
okay . today , as you may or may not know ... it doesn &apos;t matter .
what i &apos;d like to suggest is that we change the work detail tonight so that we can watch the ball game .
well , mr. mc@@ murphy , what you &apos;re asking is that we change a very carefully work@@ ed@@ -out schedule .
a little change never hurt , huh ? a little vari@@ ety ?
well , it &apos;s not necessarily true , mr. mc@@ murphy .
some men on the ward take a long , long time to get used to the schedule .
change it now , and they might find it very disturbing .

doctor :
you should prepare yourself .
john , i &apos;m so glad you &apos;ve come .
here i am , father .
the law pre@@ ven@@ ts me from divi@@ ding up my estate .
you are to have everything .
without your help , your step@@ mother and the girls will have almost nothing .
you must do something .
you must promise me .
you must give me your sole@@ mn promise .
yes , of course .
fanny : nor@@ land park , ours at last .
come to bed .
i promised father i would do something for them .
you are the most generous of men .
- i hope you don &apos;t intend to spoil them .
- not to spoil them .
i have written to mary saying that they may expect us on monday .
blow out the candle , dear .
monday ?

- have they no heart at all ?
- it is their house now , marianne .

it isn &apos;t fair , is it ?
_removed_
mr john da@@ sh@@ wood is father &apos;s only son and sons are always he@@ irs .
there &apos;s nothing anyone can do about it .
how can you be so calm about it ?
oh , mother , don &apos;t cry , dear .
but what will we do ?
will we have to live with gy@@ p@@ sies ? i &apos;d rather live with the gy@@ p@@ sies than share a roof with aunt fanny .
she &apos;s an insu@@ ffer@@ able woman . if she comes to live here , i might even poison her .
i thought of giving the girls £ 1,000 a piece .
- would that be fair , do you think ?
- a thousand a piece , are you mad ?
would you rob your only child of his ri@@ ghtful inher@@ it@@ ance ?
henry , your father propos@@ es to steal £ 3,000 from you and give it to his half-@@ sisters .
you think it too generous .
- five hundred a piece ? - oh .
that would be beyond anything generous , when you think that they will have 3,000 on their mother &apos;s death .
a very comfortable fortune for any young woman ,
i should have thought .
your papa is set on rob@@ bing you , henry .
perhaps the matter does require further thought .
mama , they won &apos;t expect you to give up your own bedroom .
it is their house now .
of course they will expect the best it has to offer . mama , our brother has a kind heart .
he wouldn &apos;t want you to be uncomfortable .
he promised papa he would look after us all .
yes , yes , he did .
and he will .
i &apos;m sure of it .
to say the truth , i &apos;m convinced your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all .
what would they spend it on ?
they &apos;ll have no car@@ riage , no horses , hardly any servants .
i suppose ... - and consider , my dear , you owe no particular gratitude to your father , nor attention to his wishes .
for we very well know that , if he could , he would have left almost everything in the world to them .
upon my word , i do believe you &apos;re right .
my father must have meant nothing more than what you said .
just a general concern for their welfare , occasion@@ al presents of fish and game and so forth .
exactly .
there , there , darling . we sha@@ n &apos;t let the poor star@@ ve .
i sha@@ n &apos;t speak to them when they come in .
yes , you will . we shall all be on our best behavi@@ our .
because we are the visitors now .
oh , really , mary .
well , here we are at last .
after you , my dear , of course .
so , el@@ in@@ or , still at your music ?
marianne still ske@@ tching away ?
you see , i remember everything .
- other way round , aunt . - marianne is the musi@@ cian .
oh , yes . - and what about you , margaret ?
_removed_
a writer .
well , pen@@ s and paper cost very little .
you have made a sen@@ sible choice .
this is an ele@@ gant dinner service . of course , you will have no use for it when you move to a smaller place .
- my dear ...
- and , of course , it belongs here .
- belongs to the house .
- and the house belongs to you .
though you neither care for it , nor need it , nor deserve it .
you know you really can &apos;t say things like that at the dinner table , to their faces .
well , it &apos;s true .
she cares nothing for nor@@ land . only for the pounds , shi@@ ll@@ ings and p@@ ence it &apos;s worth .
and it &apos;s quite clear our brother has no intention of hon@@ ou@@ ring his promise to papa .
- i know , but ...
- my dea@@ rs . mr gri@@ dley has found us two very sui@@ table houses .
bea@@ cha@@ m court and th@@ rush place .
i favour bea@@ cha@@ m court .
look , marianne , it has a ga@@ ze@@ bo .
and the grounds are very man@@ ag@@ eable , i should think .
mama , they &apos;re both far beyond our income .
well , they &apos;re both smaller than nor@@ land , el@@ in@@ or .
mama , we need to think very differently now .
we could hardly afford the gate house at bea@@ cha@@ m court .
i suppose you would have us live in a rabbit hu@@ tch .
not quite , mama .
a cott@@ age would answer very well . sometimes , el@@ in@@ or , i think you don &apos;t understand how i feel .
i do , mama .
truly i do . but we have to be practical .
oh , here you all are .
i wondered where you were all hiding .
i have just heard from my brother edward .
he is coming to stay and we expect his visit to be a long one , so we are very fav@@ ou@@ red .
_removed_
_removed_
as the el@@ dest son , he will of course inher@@ it a consider@@ able fortune , and we expect great things of him .

so much to do before he arrives .
he has a very disc@@ er@@ ning eye and i shouldn &apos;t want him to find fault with anything .

i bet he &apos;s just like her .
( servants mu@@ ttering ) el@@ in@@ or :
martha , what are you doing ?
didn &apos;t you do them a week ago ?
mrs john da@@ sh@@ wood &apos;s orders , miss . they &apos;re all to be done again with the gentleman coming .
those car@@ pets are clean .
thank you , miss el@@ in@@ or .
- good morning .
- oh , i was just ...
beating car@@ pets .
- yes .
- edward fer@@ r@@ ars , how do you do ? my horse has thrown a shoe , so i came by the way of the st@@ ables .
el@@ in@@ or da@@ sh@@ wood .
would you like some help with the carpet beating ?
no . i &apos;d better take you in to see your sister .
edward , the state of you .
where are your things ? they &apos;re sending them on from the inn .
i felt like a ride , so i borrowed a horse .
- how long are you going to stay ?
- mrs da@@ sh@@ wood : margaret . i am entirely depen@@ dent on mrs da@@ sh@@ wood , of course .
i wouldn &apos;t want to over@@ stay my welcome .
i shall have you shown to your room immediately .
what on earth possessed you to arrive here looking like a country bu@@ mp@@ kin ?
my dear fanny , we are in the country after all .
i think the first thing to do is rip out all these din@@ gy old pan@@ el@@ ings .
so dark and du@@ sty , i &apos;m sure you will agree .
and all these old books ! how could a gentleman bear to sit in a g@@ loo@@ my old den like this ?
oh , el@@ in@@ or .
well , do not let us disturb you .
- here , will you take this ?
- fanny .
- yes , edward ?
this is a library , a place of refu@@ ge .
li@@ bra@@ ries should be full of du@@ sty old books and no@@ ok@@ s and cor@@ ners and places to hide away in .
i do believe this library is quite perfect just as it is .
edward , you know you only say these things to anno@@ y me .
i &apos;m afraid it must pain you to see my sister re@@ fur@@ bi@@ shing nor@@ land after her own taste .
it is her house now .
she must do as she sees fit , i suppose . she &apos;s doing her level best to re@@ fur@@ bish me , too .
i &apos;m a grave disappoin@@ tment to my family , miss da@@ sh@@ wood .
fanny would like me to be a great man of some sort .
important , talked about , riding around in a bar@@ ou@@ che .
and you don &apos;t see yourself in a bar@@ ou@@ che ?
a pony and trap would do me very well . i want to go into the church , you see ?
quiet country pa@@ rish .
i think we all have to find our own ways to be happy .
so do i. and i think i prefer your no@@ tion of happiness .
do you ?
good . quiet country pa@@ rish it is then .
this must be a very hard time for you , your father &apos;s death .
my own father died when i was 17 .
i was like a boat that had lost its an@@ ch@@ or .
we must all have someone to listen to us , to understand what we feel .
el@@ in@@ or !
- it &apos;s not fair .
- what &apos;s not fair ? henry &apos;s got my pony .
nobody asked me if he could ride him .
- and he &apos;s pulling his mouth .
- meg , he doesn &apos;t mean any harm .
_removed_
it is a matter of principle . you are quite right .
i will speak to my sister about it . meanwhile , how about setting your si@@ ghts a bit higher than a pony ?
- mmm ? i don &apos;t think i can bear it in this house for much longer .
i don &apos;t care where we go , but we must leave as soon as possible .
i don &apos;t think we should leave nor@@ land until we see how things stand between el@@ in@@ or and edward .
mrs da@@ sh@@ wood : can you see ?
they &apos;ve formed an att@@ ach@@ ment .
oh , mama .
- how shall we do without her ?
- oh , my love .
it &apos;ll scar@@ ce@@ ly be a separ@@ ation . we shall take a house within a few miles of them .
_removed_
you will gain a brother , a real affe@@ c@@ tion@@ ate brother .
edward is very ami@@ able , but for me there is something wanting .
mama , i am not sure that he really loves poetry , and i am sure he only pra@@ ises el@@ in@@ or &apos;s dra@@ wings because they &apos;re hers .
but i require so much . i think i shall never see a man that i can really and truly love .
my dear , you &apos;re not yet 17 .
i think very highly of him .
- i like him , marianne .
- but is he worthy of you ? he has no taste for drawing or music or anything of that kind .
there are worse fa@@ ul@@ ts than fai@@ ling to appreciate your music .
but his reading last evening , so calm and spiri@@ tless .
he has a different style from yours .
_removed_
well , when you tell me to love him as my brother@@ -in-law ,
i promise i &apos;ll think him as perfect as you do .
marianne , there is no question of that .
not yet . he has family duties .
he has obli@@ ga@@ tions .
what obli@@ ga@@ tions ?
- i don &apos;t know .
- if he loves you , he will act upon his feelings whatever his family might say .
marianne , stop .
nothing has been said between us .
i do have feelings for him , and i believe he returns them .
but , please , don &apos;t hope for something that may never happen .
then you &apos;re not engaged ? - i was sure that you were in secret .
- no . well , i &apos;m sure it will happen very soon .
and so am i .
margaret ! get down from there this minute .
stay a moment if you would , mary .
i just wanted to give you a little h@@ int about my brother edward .
i think he is enjoying his visit , fanny .
you must know that my mother , mrs fer@@ r@@ ars , has very high hopes of him .
- i &apos;m sure he will ful@@ fi@@ l them .
- both in terms of his career and his marriage .
he will be expected to marry a young lady either of high rank or great fortune , pre@@ fer@@ ably both .
i see . his happiness will depend upon our mother &apos;s wishes .
if he goes against her , he will get nothing .
so you see , any young woman who tries to draw him in , will find herself gra@@ vely disappointed .
just a little h@@ int , mary .
thank you , fanny .
mama , mama !
it &apos;s from sir john midd@@ leton , a cousin of mine .
he has offered us a cott@@ age on his estate .
sir john is so gen@@ te@@ el and ac@@ com@@ mo@@ dating and he wri@@ tes in such a warm and friendly style .
- what do you think , el@@ in@@ or ?
- the cott@@ age is small and the rent is very moder@@ ate .
we shall probably need only two servants .
i think we should consider it , mama .
i shall write and accept sir john &apos;s offer immediately .
_removed_
a cott@@ age in dev@@ on@@ shire .
you will be very cos@@ y .
dev@@ on@@ shire is a long way away . not too far for our true friends to visit us , mr fer@@ r@@ ars .
i hope we shall be able to welcome you at bar@@ ton cott@@ age very soon .
thank you , mrs da@@ sh@@ wood .
upon my word , i quite envy you .
then you should go live there , aunt fanny , and we will stay here at nor@@ land .
( marianne cou@@ gh@@ ing )
sir john midd@@ leton must be very well set up to be able to offer you hospi@@ tality at so low a rent , mary .
he says he saw the opportunity to do a good turn and was glad to take it .
ah , i was , um ...
excuse me , edward .
i must just ask mama something .
surely you &apos;ll be very sorry to leave nor@@ land .
of course . - but in the circumstances ...
- yes .
these last few weeks have been very happy ones for me .
in fact , i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever been happier .
i &apos;m very glad to have been able to offer you friendship at this difficult time .
and i want you
to know that i very much value your friendship , too .
well , goodbye , mary .
edward , promise you &apos;ll come and see us soon .
well , my dear ?
i have no news for you , mama .
we shall see him again very soon .
oh , mama , look !
it &apos;s the sea . and do you think that &apos;s the cott@@ age ?
oh , mama , how romantic .
we should have thought to send thomas and alice on ahead of us .
with a fire in every room it will soon be cheer@@ ful .
who is to light the fires ?
well ...
can we really settle here , do you think ?
of course we can .
- mama , there &apos;s someone coming !
- oh , good heavens !
so , cousin mary , pleasure to meet you at last .
there we are , just a little something for your lar@@ der .
welcome to dev@@ on@@ shire .
i cannot thank you enough for your kindness , sir john .
no , no , no , none of that . i &apos;m delighted to have you here .
i like nothing so much as company . i saw you drive past the house .
you should have come in .
- so , these are your girls .
- yes . well , well , well .
how are you , my dea@@ rs ?
this is my el@@ dest , el@@ in@@ or , and marianne , and my youn@@ gest , margaret .
_removed_
very pleased to welcome three such pretty girls . i dare say we &apos;ll find you all hus@@ bands before the year &apos;s out .
- uh ... - um ...
why , whatever &apos;s the matter ? what did i say ? my youn@@ gest sister is perhaps a little young for a husband , sir .
is she ? yes , i suppose she is .
i know nothing of these matters .
i leave it to the women . my mother@@ -in-law , mrs jen@@ nings , is a great authority on these matters .
and you will meet her by and by , because i insist that you dine at bar@@ ton park today and every day

i insist , i absolutely insist .
and my dear wife wouldn &apos;t hear of anything else .
company , company , where would we be without company ? i will send the car@@ riage for you at four o &apos;clock sharp .
my dear , have you ever seen such pretty girls ?

wicked man . oh , my looking glass days are over these many years .
well , now .
we must see what we can do for them , eh , mrs jen@@ nings ?
lovers , hus@@ bands , that sort of thing , what !
well , how do we know they haven &apos;t left their hearts behind in su@@ s@@ sex , eh ?
- el@@ in@@ or has . - meg . ah , now we come to it .
i thought i saw a little blu@@ sh .
no , really .
consider nothing settled .
for a certain gentleman is coming to stay with us who may make you forget all your fan@@ cies .
what do you say , sir john ?
colonel brandon . yes , indeed .
a military hero .
served in the east in@@ dies .
they say he had his heart broken and he has never looked at a woman since .
not in that sort of way , you know .
but when he sees the miss da@@ sh@@ woods ,
i think we may find he has to change his mind . i think he may .
i think he may .
_removed_
i like that .
that is as it should be . for myself , when i fall in love , it will be forever .
very proper , very romantic .

colonel brandon is arrived . - bring him in , jen@@ kins .
sir john :
come in , dear friend .
we were just speaking of you .
i &apos;m not intru@@ ding ? not a bit of it , you couldn &apos;t have arrived at a better time .
lady midd@@ leton .
mrs jen@@ nings .
- naughty man to keep away so long .
- i had some necessary business .
mrs da@@ sh@@ wood .
miss da@@ sh@@ wood .
miss marianne da@@ sh@@ wood .
- miss margaret da@@ sh@@ wood .
- hon@@ ou@@ red to make your acqua@@ int@@ ance .
now , what do you say , mrs da@@ sh@@ wood ?
first class .
well done , indeed .
what do you think , brandon ?
yes , um , remarkable .
margaret : may i play now , mama ? of course , my dear .
your sister plays with extraordinary feeling for one so young .
she would be grateful for your good opinion , i &apos;m sure . i once knew a young woman who played with that inten@@ sity of feeling .
but i think your sister has a su@@ rer technique .
i would be glad to pass on your compli@@ ments , but why should you not tell her yourself ?
we were talking about your performance , marianne .
oh .
- remarkable .
- yes , so you said . i cannot tell whether that means you approve it or not .
i noticed you played the last movement app@@ assi@@ on@@ a@@ to ,
miss da@@ sh@@ wood , and i believe the comp@@ os@@ er marked it alle@@ gro .
and you dis@@ approve of that ?
no , not at all .
i found it ... original .
_removed_
if we are to dine at bar@@ ton park every night , we &apos;ll be paying a heavy price for sir john &apos;s gener@@ osity .
marianne , that &apos;s un@@ kind .
sir john is all af@@ f@@ ability and mrs jen@@ nings seems delighted to have our company .
el@@ in@@ or , how could you bear their re@@ len@@ tless vul@@ gar tea@@ sing ?
i was embarrassed , but they meant no harm .
and lady midd@@ leton &apos;s so cold and insi@@ pid .
and they all preten@@ ded to like music though none of them listened to it , nor cared for it !
colonel brandon listened with great attention .
yes , and found fault with my playing . i think colonel brandon has a little more disc@@ er@@ nment than your usual audience .
i think he &apos;s the sort of man that likes to find fault with everybody and everything .
mama , it &apos;s that man !
meg !
meg . colonel brandon , ma &apos;am .
i had occasion to ride over to my home in dela@@ ford earlier this morning .
i took the liberty of bringing you these flowers , mrs da@@ sh@@ wood .
oh . well , thank you .
they &apos;re beautiful .
and i looked out some music which i thought might be of interest to miss marianne .
i think you o@@ ve@@ re@@ sti@@ mate my abilities , sir .
i think not . - you have an instru@@ ment here ?
- yes , of sorts .
well , i have a very fine pi@@ an@@ of@@ or@@ te at dela@@ ford that deserves to be played on more often .
_removed_
won &apos;t you sit down ?
take some re@@ fre@@ shment , colonel . thank you , no .
i sha@@ n &apos;t intru@@ de on you any longer . i &apos;m sure i shall have the pleasure of seeing you all soon at bar@@ ton park .
well , miss marianne has made a con@@ quest of brandon , there &apos;s no doubt of that .
who &apos;d have thought it ?
i was near to desp@@ ai@@ ring of him .
_removed_
marianne is very young .
seven@@ teen is a little too soon to be thinking of marriage .
not a bit of it , my dear .
i was married at 16 , myself .
sooner the better , i say . she &apos;ll bear him some fine big sons .
what do you say , miss el@@ in@@ or ?
your sister &apos;s stolen a march on you . i hope you didn &apos;t have de@@ signs on the colonel yourself .
has the colonel spoken to you about his feelings for my sister ?
well , not in so many words , but you can &apos;t mistake it .
the man &apos;s be@@ so@@ tted with her .
he &apos;d be a fine catch for any girl , if she could get him .
and is this what everybody thinks ?
how mor@@ ti@@ fying !
el@@ in@@ or ?
- you like him , marianne .
_removed_
but because he is the only person in the neigh@@ bour@@ hood with whom one can have an intelligent conversation .
i never thought he meant ...
el@@ in@@ or , he &apos;s too old ! he is 35 , marianne .
five years younger than i am , and i never thought of myself as being quite de@@ cre@@ pit .
that &apos;s unfair , mama , you know i never meant that .
most people , i think , would still consider colonel brandon a young man .
no one &apos;s for@@ cing him upon you , my dear , but men of 35 have married girls of 17 before , i believe .
you do both realise it will be impossible for me to speak to him again .
except in company .
marianne !
come on , meg , out back .
- what for ?
_removed_
- really !
- come on , meg .
- but i don &apos;t want to go for a walk .
- yes , you do .
it &apos;s about colonel brandon , isn &apos;t it ?
don &apos;t you like him any more ? i simply felt in urgent need of fresh air and exercise .
i think it &apos;s going to rain .
is there a feli@@ city in the world superior to this ?
margaret , we will walk here at least two hours .
- i told you it would rain .
- what of it ? sweet , re@@ fre@@ shing rain .

# the wind and the rain !
well , my compli@@ ments to miss marianne and miss margaret .
marianne will be so sorry to have missed you , colonel brandon .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;d want to thank you for the books .
it &apos;s so thou@@ ghtful of you . oh , not at all .
well , good day , mrs da@@ sh@@ wood , miss da@@ sh@@ wood .
won &apos;t you wait till the rain has stopped ? no . i fear i &apos;ve out@@ stayed my welcome already .
i don &apos;t like this , marianne , and i &apos;m all wet !
- this has all been a very silly idea . - nonsense ! a little rain never hurt anybody .
come on , let &apos;s ... ( marianne screaming )
are you hurt ? don &apos;t move .
- where are you injured ?
- my an@@ kle .
you will permit me ? i know a little about these things .
no bones broken .

you mustn &apos;t walk on it . be so good as to put your arm around my neck .

mama , el@@ in@@ or !
mama , we were running down the hill .
marianne fell and hurt herself and now a man is carrying her .
don &apos;t be al@@ armed , i beg you , madam .
her injuries are minor .
a sp@@ ra@@ ined an@@ kle and some bru@@ ising only .
- there .
forgive the intru@@ sion , madam , i couldn &apos;t think how else to manage it .
i happened to be passing . i saw her fall .
clearly she was unable to stand or walk and ... so here we are .
she &apos;ll need to rest the an@@ kle for a few days
- but she should recover very soon .
- excuse me .
oh , um , will you not sit down for a moment , sir ?
- warm yourself by the fire .
- no , thank you , madam .
i won &apos;t intru@@ de any longer . perhaps you will allow me to return tomorrow to see how your daughter ...
- your daughter ...
- oh , my younger daughter , marianne .
to see how your daughter marianne is pro@@ gre@@ ssing . this is so kind of you , sir .
may we know your name ?
my name is will@@ ough@@ by , ma &apos;am . will@@ ough@@ by of al@@ len@@ ham .
until tomorrow then .
thank you again , mr will@@ ough@@ by .
well .
will@@ ough@@ by . will@@ ough@@ by of al@@ len@@ ham .
it &apos;s a good name , isn &apos;t it , el@@ in@@ or ?
it has a poe@@ tic ring .
will@@ ough@@ by of al@@ len@@ ham .
he was very handsome , wasn &apos;t he , marianne ?
he has a true natural grace and strength .
he picked me up and carried me as if i were no more than a fea@@ ther . and you put your arm right around his neck .
i saw you .

is he in the country ?
i &apos;ll ride over and invite him to dinner on thursday .
- do you know him , then ?
- know him ? very well .
what kind of a man is he ?
well , he &apos;s as good a kind of fellow who &apos;s ever lived .
he &apos;s a very decent shot and there &apos;s no bo@@ lder rider in england .
but what is he like ?
upon my soul , i don &apos;t know much about him as to all that .
he &apos;s a pleasant , cheer@@ ful fellow , and he has the pretti@@ est little poin@@ ter bitch i &apos;ve ever seen .
- was he out with her today ?
well , there you are , then .
- is he married , sir john ?
_removed_
i see where this is leading .
no , he is not married .
he comes down to visit the old lady at al@@ len@@ ham court , and he will inher@@ it there .
he also has a pretty little estate of his own in so@@ mer@@ set@@ shire .
i see how it will be . you will set your cap at him now , never think of poor brandon .
he &apos;s coming ! will@@ ough@@ by &apos;s coming !

sir john says that you &apos;re very fond of dancing .
indeed i am , and hope to have the pleasure of pro@@ ving it to you all before long when miss marianne &apos;s an@@ kle is fully recovered .
- do you care for poetry , too ?
- oh , very much .
ah , i see you &apos;re reading pope .
- are you fond of pope ?
- no .
my senti@@ ments exactly . he &apos;s too rational for me .
more to be admi@@ red than loved .
that is just what i think .
- do you know lord by@@ ron ?
- no , i have heard of him .
&quot; so we &apos;ll go no more a-@@ ro@@ ving so late into the night
&quot; though my heart be still as loving the moon be still as bright &quot;
- he is a true romantic .
- that is just the sort of thing i like .
isn &apos;t it extraordinary , mama , that it should &apos;ve been mr will@@ ough@@ by who was passing when i fell down the hill ?
- mmm . - yes .
it might have been some un@@ cou@@ th old farmer who &apos;d never read a word of by@@ ron in his life .
( knocking at door )
- oh , who could that be ?
i ... i heard of your accident .
i trust you are not seriously injured .
no , not at all . no , i see that you are not .

maybe it was a re@@ pa@@ ir@@ man . i mean , uh--
god ! uh , things break at night , don &apos;t they ? .
- mr. ea@@ st@@ man , let me be honest with you .
- no .
in my business , the only thing that gets broken in the middle of the night ... are the hearts of older men like us .
it &apos;s down@@ right tragic .
we fall for these beautiful , young things ... and we try to believe they &apos;re in love with us ... when every morning , our sha@@ ving mirror ye@@ lls , &quot; they can &apos;t be . &quot;
if i could just have the other reports , it &apos;d be fine .
oh . oh .
very wise .
i only wish i &apos;d been so wise .
- - you know , mr. ea@@ st@@ man , if i had it to do over again ...
i wouldn &apos;t try to find out anything .
i &apos;d just be grateful for whatever she was willing to give me .
a year . a week .
an hou@@ r@@ -- oh ! here we are .

are you worried about keeping up with the other students ?
- no . i &apos;m not stupid . - i didn &apos;t say you were .
- is it moving away from home ?

why don &apos;t you want to go to college ?
people .
i don &apos;t understand people .
at least the people at school know i don &apos;t understand them
- and some of them are my friends anyway .
- what don &apos;t you understand ?
girls get all go@@ of@@ y over boys .
they talk about silly pop groups and clothes and say things like ,
&quot; why are you so gru@@ mpy ? &quot; when i &apos;m happy .
and i say , &quot; i &apos;m happy . &quot; and they say , &quot; well , you don &apos;t look happy . &quot;
and i say , &quot; can &apos;t you see i &apos;m thinking ?
and can &apos;t you see i &apos;m sad ? &quot;
and i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
what do you look like when you &apos;re happy ?
like this .
_removed_

you looked like this .
that &apos;s funny looking .

i &apos;d say more satisfied .
satisfied .
maria , can you give me a hand here ?
temple !

- temple , let &apos;s get you out of ... - close it on me !
- don &apos;t be silly !
- please !
close the sides . close the sides .
please !
harder !
more !
did you see temple &apos;s han@@ di@@ work at the gate ?
isn &apos;t that the dar@@ n@@ dest thing ?
hi .
- hi , darling .
- hi .
all these years ann &apos;s been bu@@ gging me , like i could ever come up with that !
is that it ?
is that what temple &apos;s been using ?
yes , it is .
i know , it looks horrible , but it helps her .
i &apos;ll go find temple . temple !
that &apos;s mine . that &apos;s temple &apos;s .
she &apos;s had a great summer .
you won &apos;t believe the things she &apos;s fixed .
- she &apos;s wonderful with the ca@@ ttle .
- yeah . i ... i appreciate that .
i should warn you , she has her mind set on staying .
that &apos;s not an option .
ann .
i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean to attack you , especially when you &apos;ve been so generous all summer .
temple ?
temple ?
temple .
how was your trip , mother ?
you made good time .
it was long . thank you for asking .
you ready for college ?
i think i &apos;d rather stay here .
we &apos;ve talked about this .
sweetheart , you &apos;re gonna be fine .
no one expected it . it &apos;s nothing short of a miracle .
it &apos;s a miracle !
temple , this way .
- can i get that for you ? - thank you .
2@@ 24 . this is you .
- i don &apos;t have a roommate . - no , no , no .
your roommate is coming in another couple of weeks .
remember ?
everyone else has a roommate !
well , then , why don &apos;t you just think of it as a chance to settle in , sweetheart ?
- think i &apos;ll go back home ! - temple .
i know that this is strange and new ,
- but you &apos;re going to be all right .
- i don &apos;t want to stay here !
try and stay calm .
it &apos;s all right . try and calm down , all right ?
i &apos;m going to give you a moment to yourself .
- what &apos;s wrong ? - is she all right ?
interested in playing with other children ?
no , not really .
plays with toys , do@@ lls ?
she loves to rip things .
and no speech yet at the age of ...
four . she &apos;s four .
no , not yet .
- i &apos;m sure it &apos;s just a phase , but ...
- your child is clearly au@@ ti@@ stic .
- au@@ ti@@ stic . i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m not familiar ...
- she &apos;s an infan@@ tile schi@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ re@@ nic .
infan@@ tile ...
so ...
so when would she grow out of it ?
i mean , what &apos;s the next step for ...
we gener@@ ally recommend an institution .
for how long ?
i &apos;m not sure i would like that . i really ...
i ... i wouldn &apos;t want to miss her first words .
she probably will never speak .
and i &apos;m afraid there is no course of treatment .
i &apos;m talking about institu@@ tion@@ ali@@ zation .
but ...
i mean , she ...
she was a perfectly normal baby and then later she changed .
so i need to know how , why .
i &apos;m not sure you &apos;d ...
perhaps if you had your husband call me .
my husband is a very busy man and i graduated from har@@ v@@ ard ,
- so why don &apos;t you try me ?
- i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s been suggested that it may be a lack of bon@@ ding with the mother , that at a cru@@ cial phase , the mother was cold , alo@@ of , when the child most needed physical affe@@ ction .
but that is not what happened .
we have another child and she is not like this , and i did not do anything different .
temple re@@ jects me .
i ...
i want to hug her and she won &apos;t let me .
i &apos;m supposed to have done this . well , then , i can un@@ do it .
- you just tell me what to do . - as i said ,
i recommend institu@@ tion@@ ali@@ zation .
here &apos;s a list of faci@@ lities that we recommend .
dog .

temple . dog .
temple . cat .

i don &apos;t want to study french . i want to learn science .
read the page , please .
read it .
and what did it say ?
son p@@ è@@ re est poly@@ tech@@ ni ... &quot; you ...
you learned it ?
i just looked at it .
then i have the page in my mind and can read off the page .
i see pictures and connect them .
hey , save me a seat !
let me see . come out here .
- john , i got one for you . - coming through .
watch out !
i only eat je@@ ll-@@ o and yo@@ gu@@ rt !
i only ... i only eat je@@ ll-@@ o and yo@@ gu@@ rt !
you see her ?
excuse me ?
i &apos;m your roommate .
what are you doing ?
it &apos;s a machine i just made .
it feels like a hug .
do you want a hug ?
it feels really good .
so when you got in your machine , did it make you feel like a cow ?
no , i didn &apos;t feel like a cow .
but it gave you pleasure .
it made me feel good , gentle .
- the hug made you feel good . - yes .
- but you don &apos;t like to be touched by people .
do you like to touch yourself ?
touching myself &apos;s okay .
but when the squeeze machine touches you ,
- it feels better ?
- yes .
it gives you release ?
yes , there is release .
- but i need it !
- let &apos;s take it down .
- i built it ! it &apos;s mine !
- what &apos;s all the noise ?
- wait !
stop it ! - pervert .
- got it ? okay .
- yeah , i got it .
twenty three hours , 5@@ 9 minutes and four , three , two , one .
zero hour , mr. sol@@ o !
hey !
what are you doing ?
stop !
i said stop !
she says she &apos;s not going back after spring break unless she can take it with her .
- are you still there ?
- yes . and i really don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good idea .
it works for her .
it &apos;s everything we &apos;ve been stru@@ ggling to get away from .
they were perfectly clear . no dev@@ ices in her room .
could there be a better way to mark her as a weir@@ do and an od@@ d@@ ball ?
just let us try , okay ?
so that &apos;s it .
okay !
it makes me gentle .
she &apos;s a different person after just 15 minutes .
a different person ?
how can you explain that ?
i can &apos;t explain why the machine works , but i know it &apos;s not sexual .
as temple says , it cal@@ ms her .
look , all this does is to convince me that we &apos;re not equi@@ pped to deal with ms. grand@@ in &apos;s needs .
it makes her a better student .
she &apos;s able to concentrate , to inter@@ act with others more easily ...
this isn &apos;t very scientific .
- there is no emp@@ i@@ ri@@ cal evidence ...
- i can do an experiment .
i can ... i can see how it works on other people .
i can measure heart rates . i think it &apos;ll work on everyone .
let &apos;s talk frankly .
i &apos;m not sure you can get anything from being at franklin pier@@ ce .
listen to what she &apos;s saying .
she wants to do her own science experiment , something you can evalu@@ ate in her psycho@@ logy course .
i have a pen and a cli@@ p@@ board .

do you feel , a , clau@@ stro@@ pho@@ bi@@ c ,

hello , i &apos;m temple , it &apos;s very nice to meet you .
are you a scientist ?
i used to work for na@@ sa .
temple &apos;s very interested in science .
i &apos;d like to meet bel@@ ka and stre@@ l@@ ka .
they &apos;re the first dogs to come back from space alive .
that &apos;s right .
- in sp@@ ut@@ ni@@ k 5 , august 20@@ th , 19@@ 60 . - sp@@ ut@@ ni@@ k 5 , august 20@@ th , 19@@ 60 .
we &apos;re changing schools mi@@ d-@@ term because temple &apos;s been expelled .
i &apos;m sorry , why was she expelled , again ?
hitting another child with a book .
there &apos;s no excuse , but i will say this in her defense .
i have never seen her strike unless she &apos;s been pro@@ v@@ oked .
and other children have ta@@ un@@ ted and bu@@ lli@@ ed her constantly .
they make fun of her because she doesn &apos;t understand their jokes .
she sp@@ ins to comfort herself .
she talks fast , often too fast , and she talks repe@@ ti@@ tively , and then the children called her a tape recor@@ der .
then she &apos;ll go into a panic attack , and then they make fun of that , too .
excuse me . when was she diag@@ n@@ osed au@@ ti@@ stic ?
she was four , but i sometimes wonder if that &apos;s correct .
why do you say that ?
you &apos;ve seen her , she &apos;s bright .
we have a lot of experience with children with special needs , and emotional problems , neuro@@ -@@ behavi@@ or@@ al issues that we &apos;ve made a number ...
- i think that because of ...
- i &apos;m so sorry .
i really have wasted your time . i just can &apos;t do this to her .
mrs. grand@@ in . mrs. grand@@ in .
mrs. grand@@ in !
mrs. grand@@ in , please !
can i speak with you for a moment , please ?
mrs. grand@@ in , you don &apos;t strike me as the sort of person who would abuse their child or ... or deny them love and care ...
i ...
now , you wait .
i have done everything that i can for temple and if it isn &apos;t good enough , then it just isn &apos;t good enough .
but you cannot even begin to imagine the ... the chaos , the up@@ hea@@ val@@ s , the tan@@ tru@@ ms and the pain .
her pain .
you seem to be acting as if you have done something wrong , when ... when it &apos;s obvious you &apos;ve done everything right .
i ... i think she &apos;s terrific .
i know it &apos;s difficult when , as parents , we want our children to be everything we hoped for them to be and , if they &apos;re not , we think it &apos;s our fault and ...
and that there &apos;s never ever anybody out there who understands what we &apos;re going through .
it makes you feel alone , right ?
mrs. grand@@ in , i &apos;m not an admi@@ ssions person .
i ...
i just teach science , but i feel that this school might be the right place for your daughter .
i ... i &apos;d love to have her here .
the doctors wanted me to institu@@ tion@@ ali@@ ze her and ...
i don &apos;t know .
just du@@ mping her at a boarding school , it just feels like another way to give her up .
but it &apos;s ... it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s just the first step in getting her out into the world . and ...
and i know you saw the children making fun of her
- and you want to protect her . - yeah , of course i do .
yeah , what parent doesn &apos;t want to ?
but at some point , she &apos;s going to hit life head on .
and trust me , we know how different she is .
different , not less .
different , but not less .
you watch . you &apos;ll ...
you &apos;ll make friends and you &apos;re gonna ride horses .
- okay ?
- okay .
okay .
what are you doing in with chest@@ nut ?
no one is to go near that horse !
can he be my horse ?
he likes being hu@@ gged .
i want to ride him .
you &apos;ll ride . just not chest@@ nut .
why are there so many fish in france ?
french fish !
french fish !
excellent work , temple . really excellent work .
- french fish !
- french fish !
- french fish !
- french fish !
hey !
what happened here ?
- she hit him for no reason !
- temple .
come on , let &apos;s go .
- and he &apos;s done it before !
- stop . stop . temple , stop .
temple , tim will be punished for what he did , but you cannot hit people .
you understand that ?
_removed_
_removed_
- but that &apos;s not fair !
- two weeks .
no , no . there &apos;s ... there &apos;s nothing there .
and he &apos;s been like this for three hours ?
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s anything anybody could have done .
i &apos;ll send the boy around with the truck . can you do it ?
i &apos;ll take care of it , dad .
temple ?
where do they go ?
i don &apos;t know .
heaven , maybe . somewhere .
temple , when animals and people die , they stay with us in our minds .
we can still see them .
so i think it would be best not to remember chest@@ nut like this .
okay ?
i see chest@@ nut the day i arrived .
i see gro@@ o@@ ming chest@@ nut .
i see a picture of a horse just like chest@@ nut in a book .
we passed a chest@@ nut horse on route 1@@ 19 near a feed store .
there was one on a cal@@ en@@ dar at aunt ann &apos;s , there was one in life magazine
- opposite the page of mr. ken@@ n@@ edy ...
- okay . okay .
can you bring everything you &apos;ve seen to your mind ?
sure .
even if it were an everyday object , like , say , shoes ?
i see all the shoes i &apos;ve worn , my mother &apos;s and other people i &apos;ve met .
and you have three pairs , one needs a new he@@ el .
- and i see the newspaper ads and tv ads and ...
can &apos;t you ?
- this girl has an amazing mind .
- try teaching her math .
- her al@@ ge@@ bra &apos;s hopeless . - or french .
- &quot; why are there so many fish in france ? &quot;
- i want to show you something .
she thinks in pictures .
that &apos;s why she does so well when she can see the things that are being discussed .
like bio@@ logy .
or ... or shop .
those are con@@ cre@@ te things . but language or al@@ ge@@ bra ?
- it &apos;s just gi@@ b@@ ber@@ i@@ sh to her . - what &apos;s that ?
do you want to see your &quot; french fish &quot; ?
&quot; the e@@ els ate . &quot;
&quot; e@@ el ate . &quot;
ils son@@ t , il dan@@ se , il pen@@ se .
french is full of &quot; e@@ els . &quot; and this is what she sees .
she &apos;s an amazing visual thin@@ ker .
- let me work with her . - fine .
we have five minutes left . who wants to see a movie ?
- yeah ! - all right .
- j@@ .@@ d. , will you do the proje@@ ctor ?
now everybody watch very carefully because this one is all about op@@ tical illu@@ sions .
it comes as a distin@@ ct shock to most people when they realize how limited and how in@@ accurate the human senses really are .
in this house , faces at the window seem to come in ass@@ or@@ ted si@@ zes , don &apos;t they ?
that looks like mr. po@@ vey , doesn &apos;t it ?
but there &apos;s nothing wrong with the faces .
it &apos;s those windows and what they &apos;re doing to your brain .
all right , here we go .
a small one and a tall one .
let &apos;s see if we can even things out a bit .
- how do they do that ?
- sit down !
_removed_
that is the question , isn &apos;t it ?
&quot; how did they do that ? &quot;
well , that &apos;s this week &apos;s assignment . i want one page , at least .
- a full page ?
- all right , two ?
- no , no , no , no . - all right , one page . okay .
- they mess with the perspective !
- that &apos;s right , temple .
and it was a room built with di@@ stor@@ ted perspective .
- but how ?
- well , do you think you could figure it out ?
maybe if you vi@@ su@@ ali@@ zed it ?
and if you build one , i &apos;ll give you extra credit .
yeah , okay .
hey !
weir@@ do !
does she have to cha@@ lk the walls ?
look at her .
- i can &apos;t do it !
- i think you can , temple .
but i can &apos;t !
i know , i know .
i shouldn &apos;t shout .
- but measu@@ ring perspective didn &apos;t work ! - u@@ m-@@ hu@@ m .
hey , lei@@ gh , these are the specifi@@ cations you need .
success , temple ?
no !
give me a clue , please !
you have to think of all the fea@@ tures in the room , the walls , the flo@@ ors , the ce@@ il@@ ings , the doors .
got it !
you &apos;ve already gone through this , right ?
well , you can tell that that &apos;s how she painted it .
this is what she was working on the other day .
i want to go through this . it &apos;s a strange op@@ tical illu@@ sion .
well , as you can see , the horses are the exact same size .
and here is the room .
temple , congratulations .
i think this deserves a round of app@@ la@@ use .
i think it deserves a celebration .
yeah !
five , four , three , two , one .
now , here &apos;s a question .
if i wind this up and then let go , why doesn &apos;t the pro@@ pe@@ ller stay still and the body of the plane spin around ?
that &apos;s simple . the resistance of the wings .
- that &apos;s absolutely right . - and watch this .
with no wings and just one plane of resistance ,
- you have a helicopter !
- you &apos;re absolutely right .
temple . you have a very special mind , you know that ?
you see the world in ways that others can &apos;t , and that &apos;s quite an advantage .
and you know something ?
if you weren &apos;t such a go@@ of and you developed this talent , you could easily go on to college .
what would i do at college ?
well , with your mind , anything you wanted to . just pick a subject .
cows . do they have colle@@ ges with cows ?
yes , they do . and horses and pigs and go@@ ats and sheep and ...
yeah , it &apos;s called animal hus@@ ban@@ dry .
- animal hus@@ ban@@ dry .
- yeah , and it deals with the care of animals .
really , anything you wanted .
you could study people , psycho@@ logy .
i &apos;d get to understand people ?
well , that &apos;s the idea .
i &apos;ll stay here .
temple , think of it as a door .
a door that &apos;s going to open up onto a whole new world for you and all you need to do is decide to go through it .
- miss grand@@ in ?
- first off ,
i talked to my old teacher dr. car@@ lock .
and he said i should stress that it wasn &apos;t that i hadn &apos;t done the work , because i had , but i &apos;d colle@@ cted way too much data and b@@ acked it up with far too many ci@@ tations , that i needed extra time just to make it co@@ he@@ rent .
but if you look at these results , you &apos;ll see that it &apos;s not just me , but in fact , a maj@@ ority of people who become cal@@ mer when using my machine .
and that really makes a clear case for me keeping it .
and i should get a good grade .
- did your ...
- certainly more than a pass .
did your previous teacher , dr. car@@ lock , suggest the good grade ?
no , that &apos;s me .
leave it with me .
this is very important work !
you used a control group ?
they were tested re@@ sting , sea@@ ted , and most of them got bored .
this is excellent . and i think it will be a good grade .
so i keep my machine .
in that case , i &apos;ll stay .
i would imagine your new roommate will want a say in whether you keep the machine .
that &apos;s my squeeze machine .
- do i have to move it ? - no .
but don &apos;t ever move it and then i &apos;ll always know where it is .
okay .
it &apos;s almost time for the man from u.@@ n@@ .@@ c.@@ l.@@ e .
they play it in the re@@ c room .
do you want to watch the man from u.@@ n@@ .@@ c.@@ l.@@ e. ?
you can &apos;t watch the man from u.@@ n@@ .@@ c.@@ l.@@ e .
i do . i &apos;d love to watch it .
- will you show me where it is ?
_removed_
now ill@@ ya k@@ ur@@ ya@@ kin &apos;s trying to open the door , but it &apos;s locked .
and now the floor &apos;s sli@@ ding under the room .
there &apos;s a big drop to lots of spi@@ kes !
that &apos;s the other kids in the room hi@@ ssing .
- do you like star tre@@ k , too ? - yes .
- who &apos;s your favorite ?
- mr. spo@@ ck .
we have a lot in common .
maybe we can watch it on the radio .
- they broadcast it for the blind . - they do ?
let &apos;s watch it on the radio .
you &apos;re quie@@ ter now .
is that because you &apos;re in your squeeze machine ?
well , i was just getting out .
- is my voice that different ?
- it is to me .
remember , i ... i see you through your voice .
do you remember a lot of voices ?
of course . but i remember the sounds of places , too .
we &apos;re the same , only you have sounds and i have pictures .
i ... i &apos;m off to class .
i have french class . i hate it .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m in my squeeze machine .
your squeeze machine doesn &apos;t bother me .
- okay ?
- i know . okay .
bon@@ ne chance .
good luck .
thank you .
excuse me , is this seat taken ?
no .
i &apos;ve always wanted to understand the gent@@ len@@ ess that other people feel by being hu@@ gged by their mothers .
and now i &apos;ve made a machine that lets me do that .
it feels like a wire gets re@@ connected .
like something gets re@@ pai@@ red .
if it wasn &apos;t for my machine , i wouldn &apos;t be standing here today .
instead i &apos;d be hiding in my room or spin@@ ning in circles to calm myself , or hitting someone .
when i was younger , i closed myself off from people .
i didn &apos;t even speak until i was four .
there &apos;s a high@@ fal@@ u@@ tin name for this condition . au@@ tism .
but because of my machine ,
i &apos;m able to know the kindness and love that have been given to me to reach this point in my life .
today more than ever , i realize i have not walked alone .
and i thank not only my teachers , but my friends and family as well .
as in the words of the song from car@@ ou@@ sel .
when you walk through a storm hold your head up high
and don &apos;t be afraid of the dark
at the end of a storm is a golden sky
and a sweet silver song of a lar@@ k
walk on through the wind walk on through the rain
though your dreams be tos@@ sed and blown
walk on , walk on
with hope in your heart
and you &apos;ll never walk alone

this is my door .
it opens to another world .
ari@@ z@@ ona state students , gather around .
all right . come on , everybody . come on down this way .
here we go .
all right , come on in . here we go . here we go .
everybody , come on . let &apos;s go .
all right , come on in closer now . gather around so you can hear .
all right , class , listen up .
this is don micha@@ els . he runs the fe@@ ed@@ lot .
thanks , professor .
all right , what we got here at any one time is about 50 , 5@@ 2,000 head of ca@@ ttle .
now , they gotta wei@@ gh 6@@ 50 pounds to get in here .
during the three or four months they spend here , they &apos;ll put on another 400 pounds before they move into the big house for slaugh@@ ter@@ ing .
well , while they &apos;re here fa@@ tt@@ ening up , we got to keep them healthy .
so one of the first things we do when they come in off the range is put them through a di@@ p , get rid of any bugs .
- excuse me there , buddy . you okay ?
- that &apos;s a girl .
miss grand@@ in .
miss , are you with us , here ?
- i was listening to the ca@@ ttle . - oh , yeah ?
why are some moo@@ ing more lou@@ dly than others ?
i never heard so much moo@@ ing !
honey , i &apos;ve been around ca@@ ttle all my working life .
about all i can tell you is that , just like the female of the species , ca@@ ttle love to ya@@ mmer and gossip or sul@@ k .
it &apos;s always just one thing or the other .
- but like i was saying ...
- well , there must be a reason .
they &apos;re saying something .
well , i reckon you could get dr. do@@ little on out here .
he probably could tell you .
while mi@@ ssy here is listening to what the ca@@ ttle are saying to each other , why don &apos;t you boys step over here with me and see a di@@ p in action ?
now , the biggest problem you got with a di@@ p v@@ at is that ca@@ ttle can swim all right unless they tip on over .
then them babies &apos;ll drown real fast on you unless you get a hold of them and hau@@ l them out .
get up there . go !
well , there you go ! see , this is what i was telling you .
jesus !
come on , boys . earn your money !
hold them up over there !
hold them up !
come on , boys . we &apos;re gonna lose that baby .
roy !
roy , get a rope on this hei@@ fer and drag it out !
okay . okay .
well , there you go . you &apos;ll see inside .
it &apos;ll take more than that to kill a cow .
- get up !
get up !
- do you lose many ?
well , we got to run 300 of them through here in an hour .
i guess in a week , we &apos;ll lose one or two maybe .
we &apos;re doing pretty good .
do@@ little , how you holding up ?
too much for you ?
they like to walk in circles .
well , what do you know , boys ?
ca@@ ttle like to walk in circles !
dan@@ g , give that girl a prize .
it cal@@ ms them down .
they walk in circles away from the hand@@ lers .
maybe you ought to wait out here when we go inside .
go !
then when we have it in the cage , it just takes one knock to the head .
so , do@@ little , what do you think ?
- where does it go ?
- meat proce@@ ssing .
no , where does it go ?
it was here , and now it &apos;s meat .
where did it go ?
professor , i think maybe your young lady here ought to consider another line of work .
moo@@ ing ?
you want to do research and write your master &apos;s on moo@@ ing ?
cur@@ ves . ca@@ ttle like cur@@ ves . they don &apos;t mo@@ o at cur@@ ves .
miss grand@@ in , when we accepted you , we were impressed you had exce@@ lled at your previous school .
a master &apos;s the@@ sis on moo@@ ing strikes me as a lo@@ wering of the bar and i , for one , will not be the first person to give you an easy ride because of your au@@ tism .
- come up with something ...
- ca@@ ttle are prey animals .
my au@@ tism allows me to understand prey animals well .
i can vi@@ su@@ ali@@ ze the flight z@@ ones of ca@@ ttle .
a hand@@ ler outside the flight zone can keep an animal cir@@ cl@@ ing in a calm and or@@ derly manner .
but stepping into the flight zone pani@@ cs the ca@@ ttle , and ... and they change from soft mo@@ os to loud moo@@ ing .
like , prey animals don &apos;t make no@@ ises that will draw attention to them unless they &apos;re trying to warn other members of the her@@ d .
so they &apos;re warning each other they &apos;re going to be slaugh@@ tered ?
no . no . no , sir .
the ... the loud moo@@ ing is the same whether they &apos;re gonna be di@@ pped , driven around a hard corner or taken to slaughter .
i mean , they have no idea what &apos;s gonna happen to them ...
- i &apos;m glad we agree on that .
- ... but they &apos;re spo@@ oked .
and spo@@ oked ca@@ ttle don &apos;t act straight .
they get bru@@ ised , sc@@ raped , drowned , and that all costs money .
and it takes a good half hour to calm a her@@ d and that costs money , too .
it &apos;s not a good way to run a stock@@ yard .
well , i believe what &apos;s good for ca@@ ttle is also good for business .
well , get the yard to sign off on it .
- you mean don . - that &apos;s who &apos;s in charge .
sorry , ma &apos;am . no women on the lot .
my name is temple grand@@ in .
i &apos;m a gra@@ d student at ari@@ z@@ ona state ...
that &apos;s the rules , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;m a gra@@ d student at ari@@ z@@ ona state and i was here last week .
compla@@ ints from cow@@ boys &apos; wives .
they just don &apos;t want no women on the yard .
i &apos;m just doing my job .
ma &apos;am , you &apos;re holding up the line .
you &apos;re going to have to turn around and take it on off the lot .
if you please .
don &apos;t come back .
john rich@@ mond , press , ran@@ ch@@ man magazine .

thanks , ma &apos;am . take care .
- good morning . - go on in .
- morning . - go on in .
- hi , san@@ ch . - hey . hey , there .
good to have you back , son .
seems like a long time since you worked out here .
yeah , it does .
- what is this , a purple heart ?
- yeah , it is .
we &apos;re real proud of you .
gee , san@@ ch , you didn &apos;t get all these just digging la@@ tr@@ ines .
- no , sir . i was in k@@ he san@@ h .
- good for you .
excuse me , sir . i need you to sign off on my master &apos;s the@@ sis .
- how &apos;d you get in here ?
- they just wa@@ ved me in .
- what are you gonna research ?
- a@@ gi@@ tation in ca@@ ttle .
would that be moo@@ ing ?
you believe that crap ?
since ca@@ ttle are prey animals , loud moo@@ ing is a sign of ...
no way .
come on , san@@ ch , let &apos;s get some coffee .
say , did you bring back one of them little china g@@ als with you ?
no , they wouldn &apos;t let me bring back one on the air@@ plane none .
you girls got the coffee ready in here ?
- we got a man that &apos;s thirsty . - come on in !
do you have another entrance ?
- pardon ?
- do you have another entrance ?
no , ma &apos;am .
do you have any je@@ ll-@@ o or yo@@ gu@@ rt ?
in the co@@ ol@@ er . right behind you , darling .

refle@@ ctions on pu@@ ddle .
i &apos;ve eaten bu@@ lls &apos; testi@@ cles !
ate them in my aunt &apos;s ranch . regu@@ larly !
this is a waste !
hey !
you gotta remember to drink out here .
well , i have data on things that make them bal@@ k , like shadows , refle@@ ctions on water , a chain g@@ lin@@ ting in the sun .
- is that right ?
- they won &apos;t walk into sha@@ ded areas .
they need to see where they &apos;re going .
i &apos;ve lots of important information on all this and i need mr. micha@@ els to sign off on it .
don ?
don don &apos;t sign nothing .
- i need mr. micha@@ els to sign ...
- you &apos;re not hearing me right .
don don &apos;t sign nothing .
i sign everything around here .
his signature , but i do the signing .
i &apos;m not even sure if don can write .
say , if you &apos;re interested in ca@@ ttle and how ca@@ ttle act , you shouldn &apos;t just hang around fe@@ ed@@ lots .
you should be out on ran@@ ches , au@@ ctions , ro@@ de@@ os , that sort of thing .
got the big ste@@ er here . 1,000 pounds .
let &apos;s see what she got here . 20 , 25 , 25 , 25 and a half . 25 and a half , 75 .

yeah , it &apos;s a good magazine . i &apos;d like you to take a look at it .
help you out with all kinds of ca@@ ttle questions .
see you back here in about five minutes , okay ?
excuse ...
it &apos;s all doors to new worlds .
excuse me , sir ? sir ?
i &apos;m very pleased to meet you .
i &apos;m temple grand@@ in , a bachel@@ or of science , doing my master &apos;s here at ari@@ z@@ ona state , currently studying in sco@@ tt@@ s@@ dale feed yards , and i was wondering if i could interest the ari@@ z@@ ona far@@ mer@@ -@@ ran@@ ch@@ man peri@@ o@@ di@@ cal on a the@@ sis i &apos;m writing on control systems and ca@@ ttle
and why some work better than others and how they can tell the difference .
how &apos;d you get on with old don micha@@ els over at sco@@ tt@@ s@@ dale ?
i told him i &apos;ve eaten bull testi@@ cles , sir .
well , i will read anything you send in , miss grand@@ in .
in fact , here , take my card . you address it directly to me .
thank you , sir . thank you !
it &apos;s open .
sir , sco@@ tt@@ s@@ dale fe@@ ed@@ lot signed off on my ca@@ ttle a@@ gi@@ tation study .
smells like half the her@@ d signed it first .
- no , sir . ca@@ ttle can &apos;t do that .
- and i don &apos;t need the magazine .
i &apos;m a sub@@ scri@@ ber .
well , i just wanted to make sure you saw my article on moo@@ ing as a guide to ca@@ ttle a@@ gi@@ tation .
full the@@ sis is still at the typi@@ st , but you should have it by friday .
temple ?
- let &apos;s go sing near the fire . - no , ral@@ f .
# silver bells , silver bells ... #
temple !
well , master of science .
- master of science in animal science . - fantastic .
i &apos;ll bet you &apos;re glad to be back east .
- i like the west .
- so do i , but it isn &apos;t home , is it ?
what will you do with your master &apos;s ?
your mother mentioned teaching maybe .
great new school over west me@@ d@@ ford way .
i have a lot more research to do and things to write . so ...
that &apos;s right , you &apos;ve been published .
you remember scott ?
- scott ?
- scott ?
sco@@ tty , over here .
- i &apos;ll be right back . - he &apos;s our oldest boy .
new york magazine &apos;s taken a piece of his .
you remember scott ?
he used to spit in my je@@ ll-@@ o .
i &apos;m sure he didn &apos;t . temple , tell scott about your writing .
i published two arti@@ cles in the ari@@ z@@ ona far@@ mer@@ -@@ ran@@ ch@@ man .
- the ari@@ z@@ ona ...
- the ari@@ z@@ ona far@@ mer@@ -@@ ran@@ ch@@ man .
one was on good mo@@ os and bad mo@@ os .
the other was on head restra@@ ints in ca@@ ttle chu@@ tes and killing pen@@ s .
they &apos;re really badly designed .
just terrible systems . just ...
it &apos;s lovely to see you , temple .
- bye . - merry christmas .
merry christmas !
i need my squeeze machine !
i hate parties .
there are too many people and no one list@@ ens to me .
and they keep giving each other looks and i don &apos;t know what they mean .
they &apos;re just uncomfortable .
people don &apos;t want to hear all those details about ca@@ ttle .
well , i do . i wanna be with ca@@ ttle .
sweetheart , i don &apos;t want you to avoid people .
- they make me feel bad . - then ignore them .
you are the only master of science in the room .
and i am so proud of you .
temple , look at me . look at me .
do you know how people tell each other things with their eyes ?
this is me telling you that i love you and i respect you .
i will never learn how to do that .
i know .
hey !
damn it !
you are not allowed in here .
- i &apos;m doing research for an article ...
- no , ma &apos;am .
we put up with you snea@@ king in here when you was at ari@@ z@@ ona state , but you &apos;re done with that .
no college , no insurance cover@@ age , no access .
there are many other arti@@ cles i would like to write for you .
fir@@ st@@ ly , how ca@@ ttle can be introduced into di@@ p va@@ ts on their own accor@@ d .
- secon@@ dly ...
- hold on , miss grand@@ in .
fir@@ st@@ ly , your arti@@ cles have been grea@@ tly appreci@@ ated .
i got a lot of calls .
folks think you talk sense .
secon@@ dly , i told you i would read anything that you write .
and , thir@@ dly , young lady , you need another set of clothes
- when you come into town on business .
- i need to be an ac@@ credi@@ ted press person .
- can i get a press pass ?
- you asking for a staff job ?
i ain &apos;t got but four staff , and ... and two of them are book@@ keeping and distribu@@ tion .
no , i don &apos;t wanna work here .
i wanna be with ca@@ ttle , so i need a pass .
well , we can do that . but like i said ...
mar@@ y-@@ anne ?
get in here .
sir ?
how &apos;s that working for you , miss grand@@ in ?
it doesn &apos;t i@@ tch . i like it a lot .
that &apos;s my rank . they &apos;ll be able to see that .
hey , what ... damn it !
use it , temple . you stink .
- thank you . - temple ?
miss temple grand@@ in ?
i &apos;m ted gil@@ bert , from john wayne &apos;s red river fe@@ ed@@ lot .
hello , i &apos;m very pleased to meet you .
hell , i &apos;ve been reading your stuff .
how &apos;d you like to put it into practice ?
see , i lost my desig@@ ner and i need a new ca@@ ttle di@@ p .
can you do it ?
it &apos;s pretty simple , but i got to present plans in five days .
sure !
this is very clever . how did you come up with this ?
i just see things and put them together .
- so how long will it take you to ...
- and all this ?
that &apos;s to lead the ca@@ ttle in .
they &apos;re happy to follow a cur@@ ve &apos; cause they think they &apos;re going back
- to where they came from . - if you say so .
i do . so how long will it take you to do it ?
well , i have two or three more before this .
- but i need it by tomorrow !
- everybody needs it tomorrow .
i won &apos;t work any quick@@ er with you watching .
- well , i wanna watch . - okay .
hey , temple ?
this here is red har@@ ris from ca@@ ttle magazine .
very nice to meet you , mr. har@@ ris .
yeah , red , he can &apos;t make the grand opening tomorrow , so i thought we &apos;d give him a sneak pre@@ view .
so , temple , will you put some ca@@ ttle through your di@@ p while i &apos;m here ?
okay .
hey , open the gate !
so if the hand@@ lers walk slowly clo@@ ck@@ wise outside the chu@@ te , then the cow will walk counter@@ clo@@ ck@@ wise through the chu@@ te .
see ?
they &apos;ll just follow that cur@@ ve .
the ca@@ ttle just keep cal@@ mly walking thinking they &apos;re going in circles and following their buddies .
and they &apos;re happy to follow a cur@@ ve because they think they &apos;re going back to where they came from .
they &apos;re okay because it &apos;s gro@@ o@@ ved and they know they won &apos;t slip .
so when they take the next step , their center of gravity makes them drop cal@@ mly into the di@@ p and they just walk through the water .
i don &apos;t usually tell people what i &apos;m gonna write , but , miss grand@@ in , this is a master@@ piece .
- hey !
- i don &apos;t like to do that .
i &apos;m sorry there , temple .
now , look , i want you to be dressed in your best outfit tomorrow morning , okay ?
okay .
just look at this thing .
it &apos;ll take us forever to get them through here .
j@@ .@@ d. , i want you to get the tor@@ ch and , red , i want this out , this out .
i want those pan@@ els lined up and we &apos;re gonna run them straight in .
come on , boys . you two come with me .
- grab the other end of this .
look at this !
i mean , look at that !
who &apos;d build something like that ?
jess , get me some sheet steel .
we &apos;re gonna slide these pup@@ pies in here .
- eric , where &apos;s that sheet steel ?
- hurry up !
let &apos;s go . get up .
put them over in that pile and get them out of here .
she &apos;s here .
don &apos;t keep worried , boys . i &apos;ll take care of her . pick it up .
miss .
some di@@ p you got here .
who put steel on that slo@@ pe ?
ca@@ ttle can &apos;t walk on steel !
that &apos;s designed so they &apos;ll walk slowly !
excuse me , little miss . we just had three head drown in here .
that &apos;s your fault !
you killed them &apos; cause of your stupi@@ dity !
and why ain &apos;t they coming through the cur@@ ved chu@@ te ?
that &apos;d take us all day , little lady !
hey , that &apos;s my shirt !
if it &apos;s smooth , they &apos;ll follow it !
if there &apos;s stuff on it , they &apos;ll get scared !
you can &apos;t hang things !
- you wa@@ ck@@ o !
- put it all back the way it was !
temple , what &apos;s going on here ?
they killed three ca@@ ttle because of their stupi@@ dity !
they ruined it !
just a minute !
- ca@@ ttle aren &apos;t dangerous !
- temple ?
and they &apos;re predictable .
so it &apos;s not hard to design
- a system that won &apos;t hurt them ! - what are you doing in california ?
but the cow@@ boys would rather pro@@ d them and scare them .
- did you drive all night ?
- i designed a di@@ p v@@ at at john wayne red river fe@@ ed@@ lot based on the way ca@@ ttle see and think and behave and the editor of ca@@ ttle magazine said it was a master@@ piece , but the cow@@ boys killed three cows in it !
three . in five minutes .
because they wouldn &apos;t follow my design !
- temple , would you like to sit down or ...
- i can &apos;t protect the ca@@ ttle ...
_removed_
... unless i design the whole system from the moment they enter to the moment they get slaugh@@ tered .
are you talking about a slaugh@@ ter@@ house ?
well , of course they &apos;re gonna get slaugh@@ tered .
do you think we &apos;d have ca@@ ttle if people didn &apos;t eat them every day ?
they &apos;d just be fun@@ n@@ y-@@ looking animals in zo@@ os .
no , we raise them for us .
that means we owe them some respect .
nature is cruel , but we don &apos;t have to be .
i wouldn &apos;t want to have my guts ripped out by a lion .
i &apos;d much rather die in a slaugh@@ ter@@ house if it was done right !
well , it seems to me that you should be
- we can easily do it in a way where they don &apos;t feel pain and they don &apos;t get scared .
and their cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l levels go through the roof !
okay . did you hear what i said , temple ?
i think you &apos;re the one
- who should design the slaugh@@ ter@@ house .
- yeah , i &apos;m going ...
i know a slaugh@@ ter@@ house that &apos;s a mess and i know exactly how to fix it .
it &apos;s a door . it &apos;s another door .
can i help you ?
hello , it &apos;s very nice to meet you .
i &apos;d like to tour your slaugh@@ ter@@ house .
excuse me ?
hello , it &apos;s very nice to meet you .
i &apos;d like to tour your slaugh@@ ter@@ house .
we don &apos;t do tou@@ rs , ma &apos;am .
i designed a di@@ p v@@ at at john wayne &apos;s red river fe@@ ed@@ lot that the editor of ca@@ ttle magazine said was a master@@ piece ...
security ?
can i get security to the front office ?
temple , i &apos;m so sorry to leave this message on your answering machine , but i thought you &apos;d want to know that your friend dr. car@@ lock has died .
- well , i just saw him !
- apparently , he &apos;d been sick for some time .
you can call me anytime . bye , sweetheart .
i just saw him .
what are they doing ?
they &apos;re paying their respe@@ cts .
it &apos;s a way of saying thank you and goodbye .
i said goodbye when i saw him .
and this is a final chance to say goodbye .
temple . temple . are you all right ?
i &apos;m leaving now .
well , it isn &apos;t over yet .
i said goodbye when i saw him . he &apos;s not there .
i &apos;ve got him in my mind .
do you know where they go ?
no . no , i don &apos;t .
okay . i &apos;m gonna go now .
drive safely .
there you are , ma &apos;am .
my , that &apos;s a pretty bl@@ ouse .
i hope you don &apos;t mind me saying so .
some people think i &apos;m forward , but , you know , if i like something ,
i just come right out and just compli@@ ment them .
it &apos;s nice to get a compli@@ ment , don &apos;t you think ?
thank you . it &apos;s very nice to meet you . i &apos;m temple grand@@ in .
well , i ... it &apos;s nice to meet you , too . i &apos;m betty .
well , then , there we are .
are you waiting to meet somebody or something ?
no , i have trouble with auto@@ matic doors sometimes when i &apos;m nervous .
i &apos;m au@@ ti@@ stic .
my son is arti@@ stic and he &apos;s got the same thing with air@@ planes .
come on . you just come along with me .
all right . come on . and ...
all right ?
you are safe now . you &apos;re safe .
- thank you . - my pleasure .
are you a horse@@ woman ?
i mean , you know , your shirt ?
well , i like horses , but i work with ca@@ ttle .
i designed a di@@ p that ca@@ ttle magazine called brilliant .
oh , my go@@ lly , my husband read about you .
he works over at ab@@ bot .
- ab@@ bot slaugh@@ ter@@ house ?
- yeah . you heard of it ?
well , i wanna re@@ design it .
i went there , but they wouldn &apos;t let me meet with them .
but i have several ideas about how to make a new facility that will be much more hu@@ man@@ e and effi@@ cient .
well , i guess you just have to meet my husband then .
how wonderful that we bu@@ mped into each other .
- a door opened and i went through it .
- yes , you did .
and i held it .
this looks like an airport for cows .
- yeah . - yeah .
- thank you . - i didn &apos;t mean that as a compli@@ ment .
and con@@ ve@@ yor be@@ lts for ca@@ ttle ?
do you have any idea what the cost is on this ?
and you &apos;ve got solid walls and flo@@ ors .
we have those sla@@ tted for a reason . it &apos;s che@@ aper .
i &apos;m sorry , miss grand@@ in .
it &apos;s clear you just don &apos;t have the experience to design something like this .
the walls are solid so the ca@@ ttle won &apos;t be distracted by light or movement outside .
- they bal@@ k at unexpected things .
- i &apos;m sure that &apos;s nice for the ca@@ ttle ,
- but the cost , miss ...
- how much money does it cost you to pay hand@@ lers to pro@@ d the ca@@ ttle along and then hold them back when they sta@@ mp@@ ede ?
how many times a day do your chu@@ tes stop because of pi@@ le-@@ ups ?
how many cows break a leg and bring everything to a halt ?
with my system , there &apos;d be none of that .
there &apos;d be a steady , calm flow .
well , that sounds great , but you don &apos;t have any idea of whether it &apos;ll work or not .
but i do . i &apos;m like niko@@ la te@@ s@@ la or thomas edi@@ son .
i know my system will work &apos; cause i &apos;ve been through it a thousand times in my head .
i can see a chu@@ te just as the ca@@ ttle will because that &apos;s something my au@@ tism lets me do .
i can walk through a plan in my mind , examin@@ ing every beam and every ri@@ vet .
i mean , you just see a plan , but i &apos;m walking through the whole plant .
okay , the ca@@ ttle go through a series of solid cur@@ ves .
and the floor is solid , too , gro@@ o@@ ved .
the chu@@ te gets smaller , but the ca@@ ttle won &apos;t mind .
they don &apos;t ...
they don &apos;t see any danger .
they think they &apos;re just getting into another truck .
the sta@@ ir@@ way leads them gently up@@ wards .
the floor becomes a con@@ ve@@ yor .
a rest ri@@ ses up to meet their chest so they &apos;re comfor@@ tab@@ ly carried .
they &apos;ll be very calm .
nature is cruel , but we don &apos;t have to be .
we owe them some respect .
i touched the first cow as it was being stun@@ ned .
in a few seconds , it was gonna be just another piece of beef , but in that moment , it was still an individual .
it was calm .
and then it was gone .
i became aware of how precious life was .
and i thought about death and i felt close to god .
i don &apos;t want my thoughts to die with me .
i want to have done something .
thank you for invi@@ ting me .
you &apos;re the one person i wanted here .
other people would have been overwhel@@ med by what they were seeing .
it would have confused them .
i knew that you would be the only one able to sense what was really going on , who could feel what i was trying to accomp@@ lish .
i know there are a lot of things i can &apos;t understand , but i still want my life to have meaning .
i don &apos;t know that i want to hear from any more exper@@ ts .
- that doesn &apos;t work !
- we &apos;ve been trying those things for years !
will you please let me finish ?
with inten@@ sive psycho@@ therapy , an au@@ ti@@ stic child can be treated ...
but the ri@@ m@@ land report pla@@ in@@ ly shows that au@@ tism is not a psycho@@ logical problem .
- i am not familiar with the ri@@ m@@ land report .
- calm down . calm down .
calm down , sweetie . sweetie , calm down . calm down .
it would be better if you could get her to sit cal@@ mly .
- you know , try to control her . - what are you talking about ?
but we were told self-@@ sti@@ mming is good . it eventually cal@@ ms them .
self-@@ sti@@ mming is self-@@ comfor@@ ting .
self-@@ sti@@ mu@@ lation , ro@@ cking , spin@@ ning , rolling on the floor , fl@@ apping the ...
well , i think spin@@ ning is good .
and rolling , too .
self-@@ sti@@ mu@@ lation does seem to eventually calm the nervous system .
it can be a way to compen@@ sa@@ te for not being held .
and being held by another person is scary , but rolling or , or being held by sur@@ faces produ@@ ces the cal@@ ming effect that ordinary children get from a hug .
how old is your child ?
well , i don &apos;t have children .
no , i &apos;m au@@ ti@@ stic .
and i need the sen@@ sation of being hu@@ gged .
and i &apos;ve developed a machine that i get into and hu@@ gs me and i &apos;m different afterwards .
well , i didn &apos;t speak until i was four and now i have a b.@@ a. and a master &apos;s and i &apos;m studying for my do@@ ct@@ or@@ ate .
- how did you learn to speak ?
- how &apos;s it possible ?
please don &apos;t shout . please don &apos;t ...
most au@@ ti@@ stic people are very sensitive to sounds and colors .
over@@ -@@ sti@@ mu@@ lation hurts .
you know , people talking too much at once , you know , can cause us to panic .
how did you get cured ?
well , i &apos;m not cured . i &apos;ll always be au@@ ti@@ stic .
my mother refused to believe that i wouldn &apos;t speak .
and when i learned to speak , she made me go to school .
and in school and at home , manners and rules were really important .
they were p@@ ounded into me . i was lucky .
all these things worked for me .
everyone worked hard to make sure that i was engaged .
i mean , they knew i was different , but not less .
you know , i had a gift .
i could see the world in a new way .
i could see details that other people were blind to .
my mother pushed me to become self-@@ suffi@@ cient .
i worked summ@@ ers at my aunt &apos;s ranch .
i went to boarding school and college and those things ...
those things were uncomfortable for me at first , but they helped me to open doors to new worlds .
excuse me , please , but we want to hear everything .
- yes . please . - yes .
- please , everything you can tell us .
- yes . tell us , please .
are you a scientist ?
- french fish !
- french fish !
- you cannot hit people . - you think you can figure it out ?
- five , four , three , two , one .
- i have a pen and a cli@@ p@@ board .
think of it as a door .
- it just takes one knock to the head .
- i don &apos;t understand why people are cruel
- for no reason ! - you have a very special mind .
you see the world in ways that others can &apos;t .
miss grand@@ in , this is a master@@ piece .
- a door opened and i went through it .
- yes , you did .
and i held it .
i &apos;m temple grand@@ in .
